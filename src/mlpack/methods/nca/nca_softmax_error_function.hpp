/**
 * The "softmax" stochastic neighbor assignment probability function.
 *
 * The actual function is
 *
 * p_ij = (exp(-|| A x_i - A x_j || ^ 2)) /
 *     (sum_{k != i} (exp(-|| A x_i - A x_k || ^ 2)))
 *
 * where x_n represents a point and A is the current scaling matrix.
 *
 * This class is more flexible than the original paper, allowing an arbitrary
 * metric function to be used in place of || A x_i - A x_j ||^2, meaning that
 * the squared Euclidean distance is not the only allowed metric for NCA.
 * However, that is probably the best way to use this class.
 *
 * In addition to the standard Evaluate() and Gradient() functions which mlpack
 * optimizers use, overloads of Evaluate() and Gradient() are given which only
 * operate on one point in the dataset.  This is useful for optimizers like
 * stochastic gradient descent (see mlpack::optimization::SGD).
