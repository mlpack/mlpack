/**
 * The BestBinaryCategoricalSplit is a splitting function for decision trees
 * that will exhaustively search a categorical dimension for the best binary
 * split of a variable vₖ. This is a generic splitting strategy and can be 
 * used for both regression and classification.
 *
 * In the case of binary outcomes, it shown in CART[4.2] by Breiman et al.
 * that if we order the categories by the proportion that fall in class C₁,
 * and then split vₖ as if it was a numeric type, then the result is optimal.
 * Surprising, but true. In the case of multiple classes, there is no such
 * simplification. This method will search through all the 2ʲ possible
 * partitions (Gₗ, Gᵣ) of the categories C₀, ..., Cⱼ₋₁, every time assigning
 * samples with vₖ ∈ Gₗ to left tree Tₗ and those with vₖ ∈ Gᵣ to right
 * tree Tᵣ. 
 *
 * Warning: in the classification setting with multiple outcomes, this
 * algorithm is exponential in the number of categories. Therefore
 * BestBinaryCategoricalSplit should not be chosen when there are multiple
 * classes and many categories.

 *   year = {1984},
 *   title = {Classification and Regression Trees},
 *   publisher = {Chapman \& Hall}
 * }
 *
 * In the regression setting, the algorithm is similar to the preceding linear-
 * time split for the case of binary outcomes. The correctness of the algorithm
 * for a quantitative response under l₂ loss is due to Fisher.
