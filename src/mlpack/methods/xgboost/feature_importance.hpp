/**
 * After training, XGBoost can calculate feature importance to understand 
 * the contribution of each feature in the classification decision.
 * XGBoost provides two main types of feature importance scores:
 * 
 * - Weight (Frequency): This is the number of times a feature is used to 
 *   split a node across all trees in the model. It counts how often each 
 *   feature appears in all trees of the model.
 * 
 * - Gain (Cover): This measures the improvement in accuracy brought by a 
 *   feature to the model. For each feature, it sums the improvement in accuracy 
 *   (reduction in loss) brought by the feature when it is used in tree splits.
