/**
 * Loads a matrix from file, guessing the filetype from the extension.  This
 * will transpose the matrix at load time.  If the filetype cannot be
 * determined, an error will be given.
 *
 * The supported types of files are the same as found in Armadillo:
 *
 *  - CSV (csv_ascii), denoted by .csv, or optionally .txt
 *  - ASCII (raw_ascii), denoted by .txt
 *  - Armadillo ASCII (arma_ascii), also denoted by .txt
 *  - PGM (pgm_binary), denoted by .pgm
 *  - PPM (ppm_binary), denoted by .ppm
 *  - Raw binary (raw_binary), denoted by .bin
 *  - Armadillo binary (arma_binary), denoted by .bin
 *  - HDF5, denoted by .hdf, .hdf5, .h5, or .he5
 *
 * If the file extension is not one of those types, an error will be given.
 * This is preferable to Armadillo's default behavior of loading an unknown
 * filetype as raw_binary, which can have very confusing effects.
 *
 * If the parameter 'fatal' is set to true, a std::runtime_error exception will
 * be thrown if the matrix does not load successfully.  The parameter
 * 'transpose' controls whether or not the matrix is transposed after loading.
 * In most cases, because data is generally stored in a row-major format and
 * mlpack requires column-major matrices, this should be left at its default
 * value of 'true'.
 *
 * @param filename Name of file to load.
 * @param matrix Matrix to load contents of file into.
 * @param fatal If an error should be reported as fatal (default false).
 * @param transpose If true, transpose the matrix after loading.
 * @return Boolean value indicating success or failure of load.
