Using the contents of \doxyref{arma\+\_\+config.\+hpp}{p.}{arma__config_8hpp}, try to catch the condition where the user has included mlpack with A\+R\+M\+A\+\_\+64\+B\+I\+T\+\_\+\+W\+O\+RD enabled but mlpack was compiled without A\+R\+M\+A\+\_\+64\+B\+I\+T\+\_\+\+W\+O\+RD enabled. This should help prevent a long, drawn-\/out debugging process where nobody can figure out why the stack is getting mangled.
