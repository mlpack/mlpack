Definition of the Cell\+Bound class. The class describes a bound that consists of a number of hyperrectangles. These hyperrectangles do not overlap each other. The bound is limited by an outer hyperrectangle and two addresses, the lower address and the high address. Thus, the bound contains all points included between the lower and the high addresses.

The notion of addresses is described in the following paper.
