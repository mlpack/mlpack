\subsection*{Classes}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
class {\bf mlpack\+::lcc\+::\+Local\+Coordinate\+Coding}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em An implementation of Local Coordinate Coding (L\+CC) that codes data which approximately lives on a manifold using a variation of l1-\/norm regularized sparse coding; in L\+CC, the penalty on the absolute value of each point\textquotesingle{}s coefficient for each atom is weighted by the squared distance of that point to that atom. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
