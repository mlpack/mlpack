An implementation of Maximum Variance Unfolding. This file defines an M\+VU class as well as a class representing the objective function (a semidefinite program) which M\+VU seeks to minimize. Minimization is performed by the Augmented Lagrangian optimizer (which in turn uses the L-\/\+B\+F\+GS optimizer).

Note\+: this implementation of M\+VU does not work. See \#189.
