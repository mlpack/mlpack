@brief Tutorial for how to use the Reinforcement Learning module in mlpack.

@page rltutorial Reinforcement Learning Tutorial

@section intro_rltut Introduction

Reinforcement Learning is one of the hottest topics right now, with 
interest surging after DeepMind published their article on training 
deep neural networks to play Atari games to great success. mlpack
implements a complete end-to-end framework for Reinforcement Learning,
featuring multiple environments, policies and methods. Of course, 
custom environments and policies can be used and plugged into the
existing framework with no runtime overhead.

mlpack implements typical benchmark environments (Acrobot, Mountain car etc.),
commonly used policies and replay methods and supports asynchronous
learning as well. In addition, it can [communicate](https://github.com/zoq/gym_tcp_api) 
with the OpenAI Gym toolkit for more environments.

@section environment_rltut Reinforcement Learning Environments

mlpack implements a number of the most popular environments used for testing
RL agents and algorithms. These include the Cart Pole, Acrobot, Mountain Car
and their variations. Of course, as mentioned above, you can communicate with 
OpenAI Gym for other environments, like the Atari video games.

A key component of mlpack is its extensibility. It is a simple process to create
your own custom environments, specific to your needs, and use it with mlpack's 
RL framework. All the environments implement a few specific methods and classes 
which are used by the agents while learning. 

- \c State: The State class is a representation of the environment. For the CartPole,
   this would involve storing the position, velocity, angle and angular velocity.

- \c Action: It is an enum naming all the possible actions the agent can take in the
   environment. Continuing with the CartPole example, the Action enum would simply 
   contain the two possible actions, backward and forward.

- \c Sample: This method is perhaps the heart of the environment, providing rewards to
   the agent depending on the state and the action taken, and updates the state based on
   the action taken as well.

Of course, your custom environment will most likely a number of helper methods, depending
on your application, such as the Dsdt method in the Acrobot environment, used in the RK4 
iterative method (also another helper method) to estimate the next state.

@section agent_components_rltut Components of an RL Agent

A Reinforcement Learning agent, in general, takes actions in an environment in order
to maximize a cumulative reward. To that end, it requires a way to choose actions (\b policy) 
and a way to sample previous experiences (\b replay).

An example of a simple policy would be an epsilon-greedy policy. Using such a policy, the agent
will choose actions greedily with some probability epsilon. This probability is slowly decreased
over time, balancing the line between exploration and exploitation. 

Similarly, an example of a simple reply would be a random replay. At each time step, the 
interactions between the agent and the environment are saved to a memory buffer and previous
experiences are sampled from the buffer to train the agent.

Instantiating the components of an agent can be easily done by passing the Environment as 
a templated argument and the parameters of the policy/replay to the constructor. 

To create a Greedy Policy and Prioritized Replay for the CartPole environment, we would do the
following:

@code
GreedyPolicy<CartPole> policy(1.0, 1000, 0.1);
PrioritizedReplay<CartPole> replayMethod(10, 10000, 0.6);
@endcode

The arguments to `policy` are the initial epsilon values, the intenrval of decrease in its value
and the value at which epsilon bottoms out and won't be reduced further. The arguments to 
`replayMethod` are size of the batch returned, the number of examples stored in memory, and the 
degree of prioritization.

In addition to the above components, an RL agent requires many hyper-parameters to be tuned during
 it's training period. These parameters include everything from the discount rate of the future 
reward to whether Double Q-learning should be used or not. The `TrainingConfig` class can be 
instantiated and configured as follows: 

@code
  TrainingConfig config;
  config.StepSize() = 0.01;
  config.Discount() = 0.9;
  config.TargetNetworkSyncInterval() = 100;
  config.ExplorationSteps() = 100;
  config.DoubleQLearning() = false;
  config.StepLimit() = 200;
@endcode

The object `config` describes an RL agent, using a step size of 0.01 for the optimization process, 
a discount factor of 0.9, sync interval of 200 episodes. This agent only starts learning after storing
100 exploration steps, has a step limit of 200, and does not utilize double q-learning. 

In this way, we can easily configure an RL agent with the desired hyperparameters.

@section q_learning_rltut Q-Learning in mlpack

Here, we demonstrate Q-Learning in mlpack through the use of a simple example, the training of a Q-Learning
agent on the CartPole environment. The code has been broken into chunks for easy understanding.

@code
#include <mlpack/core.hpp>
#include <mlpack/methods/ann/ffn.hpp>
#include <mlpack/methods/ann/init_rules/gaussian_init.hpp>
#include <mlpack/methods/ann/layer/layer.hpp>
#include <mlpack/methods/ann/loss_functions/mean_squared_error.hpp>
#include <mlpack/methods/reinforcement_learning/q_learning.hpp>
#include <mlpack/methods/reinforcement_learning/environment/cart_pole.hpp>
#include <mlpack/methods/reinforcement_learning/policy/greedy_policy.hpp>
#include <mlpack/methods/reinforcement_learning/training_config.hpp>
#include <ensmallen.hpp>

using namespace mlpack;
using namespace mlpack::ann;
using namespace ens;
using namespace mlpack::rl;
@endcode

We include all the necessary components of our toy example and declare namespaces for convenience.

@code
int main()
{
  // Set up the network.
  FFN<MeanSquaredError<>, GaussianInitialization> model(MeanSquaredError<>(),
      GaussianInitialization(0, 0.001));
  model.Add<Linear<>>(4, 128);
  model.Add<ReLULayer<>>();
  model.Add<Linear<>>(128, 128);
  model.Add<ReLULayer<>>();
  model.Add<Linear<>>(128, 2);

@endcode

The first step in setting our Q-learning agent is to setup the network for it to use. Here, 
we use mlpack's ann module to setup a simple FFN network, consisting of a single hidden layer.

@note
The network constructed here has an input shape of 4 and output shape of 2. This corresponds to
the structure of the CartPole environment, where each state is represented as a column vector with 
4 data members (position, velocity, angle, angular velocity). Similarly, the output shape is represented 
by the number of possible actions, which in this case, is only 2 (foward and backward).

The next step would be to setup the other components of the Q-learning agent, namely its policy, replay 
method and hyperparameters.

@code
 // Set up the policy and replay method.
  GreedyPolicy<CartPole> policy(1.0, 1000, 0.1, 0.99);
  RandomReplay<CartPole> replayMethod(10, 10000);

  TrainingConfig config;
  config.StepSize() = 0.01;
  config.Discount() = 0.9;
  config.TargetNetworkSyncInterval() = 100;
  config.ExplorationSteps() = 100;
  config.DoubleQLearning() = false;
  config.StepLimit() = 200;
@endcode

And now, we get to the heart of the program, declaring a Q-Learning agent. 

@code
  QLearning<CartPole, decltype(model), AdamUpdate, decltype(policy)>
      agent(std::move(config), std::move(model), std::move(policy),
      std::move(replayMethod));
@endcode

Here, we call the `QLearning` constructor, passing in the type of environment, 
network, updater, policy and replay. We use `decltype(var)` as a shorthand for 
the variable, saving us the trouble of copying the lengthy templated type.

Similarly, `std::move` is called for convenience, moving the components instead of 
duplicating them and copying them over. 

We have our Q-Learning agent `agent` ready to be trained on the Cart Pole environment.

@code
  arma::running_stat<double> averageReturn;
  size_t episodes = 0;
  bool converged = true;
  while (true)
  {
    double episodeReturn = agent.Episode();
    averageReturn(episodeReturn);
    episodes += 1;

    if (episodes > 1000)
    {
      std::cout << "Cart Pole with DQN failed." << std::endl;
      converged = false;
      break;
    }

    /**
     * Reaching running average return 35 is enough to show it works.
     */
    std::cout << "Average return: " << averageReturn.mean()
        << " Episode return: " << episodeReturn << std::endl;
    if (averageReturn.mean() > 35)
      break;
  }
  if (converged)
    std::cout << "Hooray! Q-Learning agent successfully trained" << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
@endcode

We set up a loop to train the agent. The exit condition is determined by the average 
reward which can be computed with `arma::running_stat`. It is used for storing running 
statistics of scalars, which in this case is the reward signal. The agent can be said 
to have converged when the average return reaches a predetermined value (i.e. > 35).  

Conversely, if the average return does not go beyond that amount even after a thousands,
we can conclude that the agent will not converge and exit the training loop.
