class mlpack::tree::RPTreeMeanSplit< BoundType, MatType >"
This class splits a binary space tree\&. 

This class provides two different kinds of split\&. The mean split (i\&.e\&. all points are split by the median of their distance to the mean point) is performed if the average distance between points multiplied by a constant is greater than the diameter of the node\&. Otherwise, the median split (i\&.e\&. the node is split by a random hyperplane) is performed\&.
