.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
To use the dummy environment, one may start by specifying the state and action dimensions\&. 

Eg: 
.PP
.nf
DiscreteActionEnv::State::dimension = 4;
DiscreteActionEnv::Action::size = 2;

.fi

Now the \fBDiscreteActionEnv\fP class can be used as an EnvironmentType in RL methods just as any other mlpack's implementation of gym environments\&.
