class mlpack::tree::BinarySpaceTree< MetricType, StatisticType, MatType, BoundType, SplitType >"
A binary space partitioning tree, such as a KD-tree or a ball tree\&. 

Once the bound and type of dataset is defined, the tree will construct itself\&. Call the constructor with the dataset to build the tree on, and the entire tree will be built\&.
.PP
This particular tree does not allow growth, so you cannot add or delete nodes from it\&. If you need to add or delete a node, the better procedure is to rebuild the tree entirely\&.
.PP
This tree does take one runtime parameter in the constructor, which is the max leaf size to be used\&.
.PP
\fBTemplate Parameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIMetricType\fP The metric used for tree-building\&. The BoundType may place restrictions on the metrics that can be used\&. 
.br
\fIStatisticType\fP Extra data contained in the node\&. See \fBstatistic\&.hpp\fP for the necessary skeleton interface\&. 
.br
\fIMatType\fP The dataset class\&. 
.br
\fIBoundType\fP The bound used for each node\&. HRectBound, the default, requires that an LMetric<> is used for MetricType (so, EuclideanDistance, ManhattanDistance, etc\&.)\&. 
.br
\fISplitType\fP The class that partitions the dataset/points at a particular node into two parts\&. Its definition decides the way this split is done\&.
