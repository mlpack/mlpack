.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A Rectangle Tree has new points inserted at the bottom\&. 

When these nodes overflow, we split them, moving up the tree and splitting nodes as necessary\&.

.SS "static void SplitLeafNode (TreeType * tree, std::vector< bool > & relevels)\fC [static]\fP"

.PP
Split a leaf node using the algorithm described in "The R*-tree: An Efficient and Robust Access method for Points and Rectangles\&. " If necessary, this split will propagate upwards through the tree\&. 
.SS "static bool SplitNonLeafNode (TreeType * tree, std::vector< bool > & relevels)\fC [static]\fP"

.PP
Split a non-leaf node using the 'default' algorithm\&. If this is a root node, the tree increases in depth\&.
