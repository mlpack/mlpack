This is a specialization of the TreeType class to the \fBRectangleTree\fP tree type\&. 

It defines characteristics of the rectangle type trees, and is used to help write tree-independent (but still optimized) tree-based algorithms\&. See \fBmlpack/core/tree/tree_traits\&.hpp\fP for more information\&.
