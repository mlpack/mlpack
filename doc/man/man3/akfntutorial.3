.SH "Introduction"
.PP
\fBmlpack\fP implements multiple strategies for approximate furthest neighbor search in its \fCmlpack_approx_kfn\fP and \fCmlpack_kfn\fP programs (each program corresponds to different techniques)\&. This tutorial discusses what problems these algorithms solve and how to use each of the techniques that \fBmlpack\fP implements\&.

The problem of furthest neighbor search is simple, and is the opposite of the much-more-studied nearest neighbor search problem\&. Given a set of reference points $R$ (the set in which we are searching), and a set of query points $Q$ (the set of points for which we want the furthest neighbor), our goal is to return the $k$ furthest neighbors for each query point in $Q$:
.PP
\[ \operatorname{k-argmax}_{p_r \in R} d(p_q, p_r). \].PP
In order to solve this problem, \fBmlpack\fP provides a number of interfaces\&.

.SH "Which algorithm should be used?"
.PP
There are three algorithms for furthest neighbor search that \fBmlpack\fP implements, and each is suited to a different setting\&. Below is some basic guidance on what should be used\&. Note that the question of 'which algorithm
should be used' is a very difficult question to answer, so the guidance below is just that---guidance---and may not be right for a particular problem\&.
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCDrusillaSelect\fP is very fast and will perform extremely well for datasets with outliers or datasets with structure (like low-dimensional datasets embedded in high dimensions)
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCQDAFN\fP is a random approach and therefore should be well-suited for datasets with little to no structure
.IP "\(bu" 2
The tree-based approaches (the \fCKFN\fP class and the \fCmlpack_kfn\fP program) is best suited for low-dimensional datasets, and is most effective when very small levels of approximation are desired, or when exact results are desired\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Dual-tree search is most useful when the query set is large and structured (like for all-furthest-neighbor search)\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Single-tree search is more useful when the query set is small\&.
.PP
.SH "Command-line 'mlpack_approx_kfn' and 'mlpack_kfn'"
.PP
\fBmlpack\fP provides two command-line programs to solve approximate furthest neighbor search:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCmlpack_approx_kfn\fP, for the QDAFN and DrusillaSelect approaches
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCmlpack_kfn\fP, for exact and approximate tree-based approaches
.PP
.PP
These two programs allow a large number of algorithms to be used to find approximate furthest neighbors\&. Note that the \fCmlpack_kfn\fP program is also documented by the \fBCommand-Line 'mlpack_knn'\fP section of the \fBNeighborSearch tutorial (k-nearest-neighbors)\fP page, as it shares options with the \fCmlpack_knn\fP program\&.
.PP
Below are several examples of how the \fCmlpack_approx_kfn\fP and \fCmlpack_kfn\fP programs might be used\&. The first examples focus on the \fCmlpack_approx_kfn\fP program, and the last few show how \fCmlpack_kfn\fP can be used to produce approximate results\&.
.SS "Calculate 5 furthest neighbors with default options"
Here we have a query dataset \fCqueries\&.csv\fP and a reference dataset \fCrefs\&.csv\fP and we wish to find the 5 furthest neighbors of every query point in the reference dataset\&. We may do that with the \fCmlpack_approx_kfn\fP algorithm, using the default of the \fCDrusillaSelect\fP algorithm with default parameters\&.

Convenient timers for parts of the program operation are printed\&. The results, saved in \fCn\&.csv\fP and \fCd\&.csv\fP, indicate the furthest neighbors and distances for each query point\&. The row of the output file indicates the query point that the results are for\&. The neighbors are listed from furthest to nearest; so, the 4th element in the 3rd row of \fCd\&.csv\fP indicates the distance between the 3rd query point in \fCqueries\&.csv\fP and its approximate 4th furthest neighbor\&. Similarly, the same element in \fCn\&.csv\fP indicates the index of the approximate 4th furthest neighbor (with respect to \fCrefs\&.csv\fP)\&.
.SS "Specifying algorithm parameters for DrusillaSelect"
The \fC-p\fP (\fC--num_projections\fP) and \fC-t\fP (\fC--num_tables\fP) parameters affect the running of the \fCDrusillaSelect\fP algorithm and the QDAFN algorithm\&. Specifically, larger values for each of these parameters will search more possible candidate furthest neighbors and produce better results (at the cost of runtime)\&. More details on how each of these parameters works is available in the original papers, the \fBmlpack\fP source, or the documentation given by \fC--help\fP\&.
.PP
In the example below, we run \fCDrusillaSelect\fP to find 4 furthest neighbors using 10 tables and 2 points in each table\&. In this case we have chosen to omit the \fC-n\fP \fCn\&.csv\fP option, meaning that only the output candidate distances will be written to \fCd\&.csv\fP\&.

.SS "Using QDAFN instead of DrusillaSelect"
The algorithm to be used for approximate furthest neighbor search can be specified with the \fC--algorithm\fP (\fC-a\fP) option to the \fCmlpack_approx_kfn\fP program\&. Below, we use the QDAFN algorithm instead of the default\&. We leave the \fC-p\fP and \fC-t\fP options at their defaults---even though QDAFN often requires more tables and points to get the same quality of results\&.

.SS "Printing results quality with exact distances"
The \fCmlpack_approx_kfn\fP program can calculate the quality of the results if the \fC--calculate_error\fP (\fC-e\fP) flag is specified\&. Below we use the program with its default parameters and calculate the error, which is displayed in the output\&.

In this case, a minimum error of 1 indicates an exact result, and over the entire query set the algorithm has returned a furthest neighbor candidate with maximum error 1\&.28712\&.
.SS "Using cached exact distances for quality results"
However, for large datasets, calculating the error may take a long time, because the exact furthest neighbors must be calculated\&. Therefore, if the exact furthest neighbor distances are already known, they may be passed in with the \fC--exact_distances_file\fP (\fC-x\fP) option in order to avoid the calculation\&. In the example below, we assume \fCexact\&.csv\fP contains the exact furthest neighbor distances\&. We run the \fCqdafn\fP algorithm in this example\&.

Note that the \fC-e\fP option must be specified for the \fC-x\fP option have any effect\&.

.SS "Saving a model for later use"
The \fCmlpack_approx_kfn\fP and \fCmlpack_kfn\fP programs both allow models to be saved and loaded for future use\&. The \fC--output_model_file\fP (\fC-M\fP) option allows specifying where to save a model, and the \fC--input_model_file\fP (\fC-m\fP) option allows a model to be loaded instead of trained\&. So, if you specify \fC--input_model_file\fP then you do not need to specify \fC--reference_file\fP (\fC-r\fP), \fC--num_projections\fP (\fC-p\fP), or \fC--num_tables\fP (\fC-t\fP)\&.
.PP
The example below saves a model with 10 projections and 5 tables\&. Note that neither \fC--query_file\fP (\fC-q\fP) nor \fC-k\fP are specified; this run only builds the model and saves it to \fCmodel\&.bin\fP\&.

These options work in the same way for both the \fCmlpack_approx_kfn\fP and \fCmlpack_kfn\fP programs\&.
.SS "Final command-line program notes"
Both the \fCmlpack_kfn\fP and \fCmlpack_approx_kfn\fP programs contain numerous options not fully documented in these short examples\&. You can run each program with the \fC--help\fP (\fC-h\fP) option for more information\&.
.SH "DrusillaSelect C++ class"
.PP
\fBmlpack\fP provides a simple \fCDrusillaSelect\fP C++ class that can be used inside of C++ programs to perform approximate furthest neighbor search\&. The class has only one template parameter---\fCMatType---which\fP specifies the type of matrix to be use\&. That means the class can be used with either dense data (of type \fCarma::mat\fP) or sparse data (of type \fCarma::sp_mat\fP)\&.
.PP
The following examples show simple usage of this class\&.
.SS "Approximate furthest neighbors with defaults"
The code below builds a \fCDrusillaSelect\fP model with default options on the matrix \fCdataset\fP, then queries for the approximate furthest neighbor of every point in the \fCqueries\fP matrix\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
#include <mlpack/methods/approx_kfn/drusilla_select\&.hpp>

using namespace mlpack::neighbor;

// The reference dataset\&.
extern arma::mat dataset;
// The query set\&.
extern arma::mat queries;

// Construct the model with defaults\&.
DrusillaSelect<> ds(dataset);

// Query the model, putting output into the following two matrices\&.
arma::mat distances;
arma::Mat<size_t> neighbors;
ds\&.Search(queries, 1, neighbors, distances);
.fi
.PP
.PP
At the end of this code, both the \fCdistances\fP and \fCneighbors\fP matrices will have number of columns equal to the number of columns in the \fCqueries\fP matrix\&. So, each column of the \fCdistances\fP and \fCneighbors\fP matrices are the distances or neighbors of the corresponding column in the \fCqueries\fP matrix\&.
.SS "Custom numbers of tables and projections"
The following example constructs a DrusillaSelect model with 10 tables and 5 projections\&. Once that is done it performs the same task as the previous example\&.
.PP
.PP

ds\&.Search(queries, 1, neighbors, distances);
.fi
.PP
.SS "Accessing the candidate set"
The \fCDrusillaSelect\fP algorithm merely scans the reference set and extracts a number of points that will be queried in a brute-force fashion when the \fCSearch()\fP method is called\&. We can access this set with the \fCCandidateSet()\fP method\&. The code below prints the fifth point of the candidate set\&.
.PP

#include <mlpack/methods/approx_kfn/drusilla_select\&.hpp>

.PP
.SS "Retraining on a new reference set"
It is possible to retrain a \fCDrusillaSelect\fP model with new parameters or with a new reference set\&. This is functionally equivalent to creating a new model\&. The example code below creates a first \fCDrusillaSelect\fP model using 3 tables and 10 projections, and then retrains this with the same reference set using 10 tables and 3 projections\&.
.PP

DrusillaSelect<> ds(dataset, 3, 10);

// Now retrain with different parameters\&.
ds\&.Train(dataset, 10, 3);
.fi
.PP
.SS "Running on sparse data"
We can set the template parameter for \fCDrusillaSelect\fP to \fCarma::sp_mat\fP in order to perform furthest neighbor search on sparse data\&. This code below creates a \fCDrusillaSelect\fP model using 4 tables and 6 projections with sparse input data, then searches for 3 approximate furthest neighbors\&.

DrusillaSelect<arma::sp_mat> ds(dataset, 4, 6);

// Search on query data\&.
arma::Mat<size_t> neighbors;
arma::mat distances;
ds\&.Search(querySet, 3, neighbors, distances);
.fi
.PP
.SH "QDAFN C++ class"
.PP
\fBmlpack\fP also provides a standalone simple \fCQDAFN\fP class for furthest neighbor search\&. The API for this class is virtually identical to the \fCDrusillaSelect\fP class, and also has one template parameter to specify the type of matrix to be used (dense or sparse or other)\&.
.PP
The following subsections demonstrate usage of the \fCQDAFN\fP class in the same way as the previous section's examples for \fCDrusillaSelect\fP\&.
.SS "Approximate furthest neighbors with defaults"
The code below builds a \fCQDAFN\fP model with default options on the matrix \fCdataset\fP, then queries for the approximate furthest neighbor of every point in the \fCqueries\fP matrix\&.

.PP
.PP
At the end of this code, both the \fCdistances\fP and \fCneighbors\fP matrices will have number of columns equal to the number of columns in the \fCqueries\fP matrix\&. So, each column of the \fCdistances\fP and \fCneighbors\fP matrices are the distances or neighbors of the corresponding column in the \fCqueries\fP matrix\&.

.PP
.SS "Accessing the candidate set"
The \fCQDAFN\fP algorithm scans the reference set, extracting points that have been projected onto random directions\&. Each random direction corresponds to a single table\&. The \fCQDAFN\fP class stores these points as a vector of matrices, which can be accessed with the \fCCandidateSet()\fP method\&. The code below prints the fifth point of the candidate set of the third table\&.

The extensive \fCNeighborSearch\fP class also provides a way to search for approximate furthest neighbors using a different, tree-based technique\&. For full documentation on this class, see the \fBNeighborSearch tutorial\fP\&. The \fCKFN\fP class is a convenient typedef of the \fCNeighborSearch\fP class that can be used to perform the furthest neighbors task with kd-trees\&.
.PP
In the following subsections, the \fCKFN\fP class is used in short code examples\&.
.SS "Simple furthest neighbors example"
The \fCKFN\fP class has construction semantics similar to \fCDrusillaSelect\fP and \fCQDAFN\fP\&. The example below constructs a \fCKFN\fP object (which will build the tree on the reference set), but note that the third parameter to the constructor allows us to specify our desired level of approximation\&. In this example we choose epsilon = 0\&.05\&. Then, the code searches for 3 approximate furthest neighbors\&.
.PP

#include <mlpack/methods/neighbor_search/neighbor_search\&.hpp>

.SS "Searching in brute-force mode"
If desired, brute-force search ('naive search') can be used to find the furthest neighbors; however, the result will not be approximate---it will be exact (since every possibility will be considered)\&.
