The \fBCOUNTER\fP variable is used in most cases to guarantee a unique global identifier for options declared using the PARAM_*() macros\&. However, not all compilers have this support--most notably, gcc < 4\&.3\&. In that case, the \fBLINE\fP macro is used as an attempt to get a unique global identifier, but collisions are still possible, and they produce bizarre error messages\&. See https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues/100 for more information\&.
