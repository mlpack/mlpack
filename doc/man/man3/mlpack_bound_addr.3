.PP
Translate the address to the point\&. Be careful, the point and the address variables should be equal-sized and the type of the address should correspond to the type of the vector\&.
.PP
The function makes the backward transform to the function above\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIaddress\fP An address to translate\&. 
.br
\fIpoint\fP The point that corresponds to the address\&.

.PP
Compare two addresses\&. The function returns 1 if the first address is greater than the second one, -1 if the first address is less than the second one, otherwise the function returns 0\&.

.SS "template<typename AddressType , typename VecType > void mlpack::bound::addr::PointToAddress (AddressType & address, const VecType & point)"

.PP
Calculate the address of a point\&. Be careful, the point and the address variables should be equal-sized and the type of the address should correspond to the type of the vector\&.
.PP
The function maps each floating point coordinate to an equal-sized unsigned integer datatype in such a way that the transform preserves the ordering (i\&.e\&. lower floating point values correspond to lower integers)\&. Thus, the mapping saves the exponent and the mantissa of each floating point value consequently, furthermore the exponent is stored before the mantissa\&. In the case of negative numbers the resulting integer value should be inverted\&. In the multi-dimensional case, after we transform the representation, we have to interleave the bits of the new representation across all the elements in the address vector\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIaddress\fP The resulting address\&. 
.br
\fIpoint\fP The point that is being translated to the address\&.
