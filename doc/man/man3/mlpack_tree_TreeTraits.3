class mlpack::tree::TreeTraits< TreeType >"
The \fBTreeTraits\fP class provides compile-time information on the characteristics of a given tree type\&. 

These include traits such as whether or not a node knows the distance to its parent node, or whether or not the subspaces represented by children can overlap\&.
.PP
These traits can be used for static compile-time optimization:
.PP
.PP
.nf
// This if statement will be optimized out at compile time!
if (TreeTraits<TreeType>::HasOverlappingChildren == false)
{
  // Do a simpler computation because no children overlap\&.
}
else
{
  // Do the full, complex calculation\&.
}
.fi
.PP
.PP
The traits can also be used in conjunction with SFINAE to write specialized versions of functions:
.PP
.PP
.nf
template<typename TreeType>
void Compute(TreeType& node,
             std::enable_if_t<
                 TreeTraits<TreeType>::RearrangesDataset>*)
{
  // Computation where special dataset-rearranging tree constructor is
  // called\&.
}

template<typename TreeType>
void Compute(TreeType& node,
             std::enable_if_t<
                 !TreeTraits<TreeType>::RearrangesDataset>*)
{
  // Computation where normal tree constructor is called\&.
}
.fi
.PP
.PP
In those two examples, the \fBstd::enable_if_t<>\fP class takes a boolean template parameter which allows that function to be called when the boolean is true\&.
.PP
Each trait must be a static const value and not a function; only const values can be used as template parameters (or constexprs can be used too)\&. By default (the unspecialized implementation of \fBTreeTraits\fP), each parameter is set to make as few assumptions about the tree as possible; so, even if \fBTreeTraits\fP is not specialized for a particular tree type, tree-based algorithms should still work\&.
.PP
When you write your own tree, you must specialize the \fBTreeTraits\fP class to your tree type and set the corresponding values appropriately\&. See \fBmlpack/core/tree/binary_space_tree/traits\&.hpp\fP for an example\&.
