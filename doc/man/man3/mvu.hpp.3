An implementation of Maximum Variance Unfolding\&. This file defines an MVU class as well as a class representing the objective function (a semidefinite program) which MVU seeks to minimize\&. Minimization is performed by the Augmented Lagrangian optimizer (which in turn uses the L-BFGS optimizer)\&.
.PP
Note: this implementation of MVU does not work\&. See #189\&.
