class mlpack::tree::TreeTraits< CoverTree< MetricType, StatisticType, MatType, RootPointPolicy > >"
The specialization of the \fBTreeTraits\fP class for the \fBCoverTree\fP tree type\&. 

It defines characteristics of the cover tree, and is used to help write tree-independent (but still optimized) tree-based algorithms\&. See \fBmlpack/core/tree/tree_traits\&.hpp\fP for more information\&.
