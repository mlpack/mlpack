Defines the SpillDualTreeTraverser for the SpillTree tree type\&. This is a nested class of SpillTree which traverses two trees in a depth-first manner with a given set of rules which indicate the branches which can be pruned and the order in which to recurse\&. The Defeatist template parameter determines if the traversers must do defeatist search on overlapping nodes\&.
