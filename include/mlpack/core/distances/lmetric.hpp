/**
 * The L_p metric for arbitrary integer p, with an option to take the root.
 *
 * This class implements the standard L_p metric for two arbitrary vectors @f$ x
 * @f$ and @f$ y @f$ of dimensionality @f$ n @f$:
 *
 * @f[
 * d(x, y) = \left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n} | x_i - y_i |^p \right)^{\frac{1}{p}}.
 * @f]
 *
 * The value of p is given as a template parameter.
 *
 * In addition, the function @f$ d(x, y) @f$ can be simplified, neglecting the
 * p-root calculation.  This is done by specifying the TakeRoot template
 * parameter to be false.  Then,
 *
 * @f[
 * d(x, y) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} | x_i - y_i |^p
 * @f]
 *
 * It is faster to compute that distance, so TakeRoot is by default off.
 * However, when TakeRoot is false, the distance given is not actually a true
 * metric -- it does not satisfy the triangle inequality.  Some mlpack methods
 * do not require the triangle inequality to operate correctly (such as the
 * BinarySpaceTree), but setting TakeRoot = false in some cases will cause
 * incorrect results.
 *
 * A few convenience typedefs are given:
 *
 *  - ManhattanDistance
 *  - EuclideanDistance
 *  - SquaredEuclideanDistance
 *
 * @tparam Power Power of metric; i.e. Power = 1 gives the L1-norm (Manhattan
 *    distance).
 * @tparam TakeRoot If true, the Power'th root of the result is taken before it
 *    is returned.  Setting this to false causes the metric to not satisfy the
 *    Triangle Inequality (be careful!).
