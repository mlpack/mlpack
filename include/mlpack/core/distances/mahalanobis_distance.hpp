/**
 * The Mahalanobis distance, which is essentially a stretched Euclidean
 * distance.  Given a square inverse covariance matrix @f$ Q @f$ of size @f$ d
 * @f$ x @f$ d @f$, where @f$ d @f$ is the dimensionality of the points it will
 * be evaluating, and given two vectors @f$ x @f$ and @f$ y @f$ also of
 * dimensionality @f$ d @f$,
 *
 * @f[
 * d(x, y) = \sqrt{(x - y)^T Q (x - y)}
 * @f]
 *
 * where Q is the inverse covariance matrix.
 *
 * Because each evaluation multiplies (x_1 - x_2) by the inverse covariance
 * matrix, it is typically much quicker to use an LMetric and simply stretch the
 * actual dataset itself before performing any evaluations.  However, this class
 * is provided for convenience.
 *
 * If you wish to use the KNN class or other tree-based algorithms with this
 * distance, it is recommended to instead stretch the dataset first, by
 * decomposing Q = L^T L (perhaps via a Cholesky decomposition), and then
 * multiply the data by L.  If you still wish to use the KNN class with a custom
 * distance anyway, you will need to use a different tree type than the default
 * KDTree, which only works with the LMetric class.
 *
 * Similar to the LMetric class, this offers a template parameter TakeRoot
 * which, when set to false, will instead evaluate the distance
 *
 * @f[
 * d(x, y) = (x - y)^T Q (x - y)
 * @f]
 *
 * which is faster to evaluate.
 *
 * @tparam TakeRoot If true, takes the root of the output.  It is slightly
 *   faster to leave this at the default of false, but this means the metric may
 *   not satisfy the triangle inequality and may not be usable for methods that
 *   expect a true metric.
