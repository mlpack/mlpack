/**
 * The Intersection-over-Union (IoU) distance is a distance metric that
 * satisfies the triangle inequality and other properties of metrics.  It is
 * defined as 1 minus the IoU metric:
 *
 * ```
 * d(x, y) = 1 - iou_metric(x, y)
 * ```
 *
 * See the documentation for the `IoU` class for more information on the
 * intersection-over-union documentation (in metrics/iou_metric.hpp).
 *
 * For more information on why this satisfies the triangle inequality and other
 * properties of metrics, see
 *
 * ```

 * The inputs to Evaluate() are expected to be a four-dimensional vector
 * representing the bounding boxes.  There are two representations that can be
 * used, depending on the value of the `UseCoordinates` template parameter.
 *
 * If `UseCoordinates` is `false` (the default), then each four-dimensional
 * vector specifies (in order) the values `[x0, y0, h, w]`, where `(x0, y0)` is
 * the lower left coordinates, `h` is the height, and `w` is the width.
 *
 * If `UseCoordinates` is `true`, then each four-dimensional vector specifies
 * (in order) the values `[x0, y0, x1, y1]`, where `(x0, y0)` is the lower left
 * coordinates, and `(x1, y1)` is the upper right coordinate.
