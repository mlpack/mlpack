/**
 * The vantage point tree (which is also called the metric tree. Vantage point
 * trees and metric trees were invented independently by Yianilos an Uhlmann) is
 * a kind of the binary space tree. When recursively splitting nodes, the VPTree
 * class selects the vantage point and splits the node according to the distance
 * to this point. Thus, points that are closer to the vantage point form the
 * inner subtree. Other points form the outer subtree. The vantage point is
 * contained in the first (inner) node.
 *
 * This implementation differs from the original algorithms. Namely, vantage
 * points are not contained in intermediate nodes. The tree has points only in
 * the leaves of the tree.
