/**
 * A binary space partitioning tree, such as a KD-tree or a ball tree.  Once the
 * bound and type of dataset is defined, the tree will construct itself.  Call
 * the constructor with the dataset to build the tree on, and the entire tree
 * will be built.
 *
 * This particular tree does not allow growth, so you cannot add or delete nodes
 * from it.  If you need to add or delete a node, the better procedure is to
 * rebuild the tree entirely.
 *
 * This tree does take one runtime parameter in the constructor, which is the
 * max leaf size to be used.
 *
 * @tparam DistanceType The distance metric used for tree-building.  The
 *     BoundType may place restrictions on the metrics that can be used.
 * @tparam StatisticType Extra data contained in the node.  See statistic.hpp
 *     for the necessary skeleton interface.
 * @tparam MatType The dataset class.
 * @tparam BoundType The bound used for each node.  HRectBound, the default,
 *     requires that an LMetric<> is used for DistanceType (so,
 *     EuclideanDistance, ManhattanDistance, etc.).
 * @tparam SplitType The class that partitions the dataset/points at a
 *     particular node into two parts. Its definition decides the way this split
 *     is done.
