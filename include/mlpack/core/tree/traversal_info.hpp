/**
 * The TraversalInfo class holds traversal information which is used in
 * dual-tree (and single-tree) traversals.  A traversal should be updating the
 * members of this class before Score() is called.  This class should be held as
 * a member of the RuleType class and the interface to it should be through a
 * TraversalInfo() method.
 *
 * The information held by this class is the last node combination visited
 * before the current node combination was recursed into, and the score
 * resulting from when Score() was called on that combination.  However, this
 * information is identical for a query node and a reference node in a
 * particular node combination, so traversals only need to update the
 * TraversalInfo object in a query node (and the algorithms should only use the
 * TraversalInfo object from a query node).
 *
 * In general, this auxiliary traversal information is used to try and make a
 * prune without needing to call BaseCase() or calculate the distance between
 * nodes.  Using this information you can place bounds on the distance between
 * the two nodes quickly.
 *
 * If the traversal is not updating the members of this class correctly, a
 * likely result is a null pointer dereference.  Dual-tree algorithms should
 * assume that the members are set properly and should not need to check for
 * null pointers.
 *
 * There is one exception, which is the root node combination; the score can be
 * set to 0 and the query and reference nodes can just be set to the root nodes;
 * no algorithm should be able to prune the root combination anyway.
