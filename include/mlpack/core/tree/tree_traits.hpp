/**
 * The TreeTraits class provides compile-time information on the characteristics
 * of a given tree type.  These include traits such as whether or not a node
 * knows the distance to its parent node, or whether or not the subspaces
 * represented by children can overlap.
 *
 * These traits can be used for static compile-time optimization:
 *
 * @code
 * // This if statement will be optimized out at compile time!
 * if (TreeTraits<TreeType>::HasOverlappingChildren == false)
 * {
 *   // Do a simpler computation because no children overlap.
 * }
 * else
 * {
 *   // Do the full, complex calculation.
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The traits can also be used in conjunction with SFINAE to write specialized
 * versions of functions:
 *
 * @code
 * template<typename TreeType>
 * void Compute(TreeType& node,
 *              std::enable_if_t<
 *                  TreeTraits<TreeType>::RearrangesDataset>*)
 * {
 *   // Computation where special dataset-rearranging tree constructor is
 *   // called.
 * }
 *
 * template<typename TreeType>
 * void Compute(TreeType& node,
 *              std::enable_if_t<
 *                  !TreeTraits<TreeType>::RearrangesDataset>*)
 * {
 *   // Computation where normal tree constructor is called.
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * In those two examples, the std::enable_if_t<> class takes a boolean template
 * parameter which allows that function to be called when the boolean is true.
 *
 * Each trait must be a static const value and not a function; only const values
 * can be used as template parameters (or constexprs can be used too).  By
 * default (the unspecialized implementation of TreeTraits), each parameter is
 * set to make as few assumptions about the tree as possible; so, even if
 * TreeTraits is not specialized for a particular tree type, tree-based
 * algorithms should still work.
 *
 * When you write your own tree, you must specialize the TreeTraits class to
 * your tree type and set the corresponding values appropriately.  See
 * mlpack/core/tree/binary_space_tree/traits.hpp for an example.
