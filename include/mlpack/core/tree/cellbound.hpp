 * Definition of the CellBound class. The class describes a bound that consists
 * of a number of hyperrectangles. These hyperrectangles do not overlap each
 * other. The bound is limited by an outer hyperrectangle and two addresses,
 * the lower address and the high address. Thus, the bound contains all points
 * included between the lower and the high addresses.
 *
 * The notion of addresses is described in the following paper.
