/**
 * Allows us to output to an ostream with a prefix at the beginning of each
 * line, in the same way we would output to cout or cerr.  The prefix is
 * specified in the constructor (as well as the destination ostream).  A newline
 * must be passed to the stream, and then the prefix will be prepended to the
 * next line.  For example,
 *
 * @code
 * PrefixedOutStream outstr(MLPACK_COUT_STREAM, "[TEST] ");
 * outstr << "Hello world I like " << 7.5;
 * outstr << "...Continue" << std::endl;
 * outstr << "After the CR\n" << std::endl;
 * @endcode
 *
 * would give, on MLPACK_COUT_STREAM,
 *
 * @code
 * [TEST] Hello world I like 7.5...Continue
 * [TEST] After the CR
 * [TEST]
 * @endcode
 *
 * These objects are used for the mlpack::Log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, and
 * FATAL).
