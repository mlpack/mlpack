/**
 * A Diagonal Gaussian Mixture Model. 
 * This class uses maximum likelihood loss functions to estimate the parameters
 * of the DiagonalGMM on a given dataset via the given fitting mechanism, 
 * defined by the FittingType template parameter.  The DiagonalGMM can be
 * trained using normal data, or data with probabilities of being
 * from this GMM (see DiagonalGMM::Train() for more information).
 * The DiagonalGMM is the same as GMM except for wrapping gmm_diag class.
 *
 * The Train() method uses a template type 'FittingType'.  The FittingType
 * template class must provide a way for the DiagonalGMM to train on data.
 * It must provide the following two functions:
 *
 * @code
 * void Estimate(
 *     const arma::mat& observations,
 *     std::vector<DiagonalGaussianDistribution>& dists,
 *     arma::vec& weights);
 *
 * void Estimate(
 *     const arma::mat& observations,
 *     const arma::vec& probabilities,
 *     std::vector<DiagonalGaussianDistribution>& dists,
 *     arma::vec& weights);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Example use:
 *
 * @code
 * // Set up a mixture of 5 gaussians in a 4-dimensional space.
 * DiagonalGMM g(5, 4);
 *
 * // Train the DiagonalGMM given the data observations, using the default
 * // EM fitting mechanism.
 * 
 * g.Train(data);
 *
 * // Get the probability of 'observation' being observed from this
 * // DiagoanlGMM.
 * double probability = g.Probability(observation);
 *
 * // Get a random observation from the DiagonalGMM.
 * arma::vec observation = g.Random();
 * @endcode
