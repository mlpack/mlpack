/**
 * Implementation of a standard feed forward network.  Any layer that inherits
 * from the base `Layer` class can be added to this model.  For recursive neural
 * networks, see the `RNN` class.
 *
 * In general, a network can be created by using the `Add()` method to add
 * layers to the network.  Then, training can be performed with `Train()`, and
 * data points can be passed through the trained network with `Predict()`.
 *
 * Although the actual types passed as input will be matrix objects with one
 * data point per column, each data point can be a tensor of arbitrary shape.
 * If data points are not 1-dimensional vectors, then set the shape of the input
 * with `InputDimensions()` before calling `Train()`.
 *
 * More granular functionality is available with `Forward()`, Backward()`, and
 * `Evaluate()`, or even by accessing the individual layers directly with
 * `Network()`.
 *
 * @tparam OutputLayerType The output layer type used to evaluate the network.
 * @tparam InitializationRuleType Rule used to initialize the weight matrix.
 * @tparam MatType Type of matrix to be given as input to the network.
 * @tparam MatType Type of matrix to be produced as output from the last
 *     layer.
