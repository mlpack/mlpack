/**
 * A class that represents a Hidden Markov Model with an arbitrary type of
 * emission distribution.  This HMM class supports training (supervised and
 * unsupervised), prediction of state sequences via the Viterbi algorithm,
 * estimation of state probabilities, generation of random sequences, and
 * calculation of the log-likelihood of a given sequence.
 *
 * The template parameter, Distribution, specifies the distribution which the
 * emissions follow.  The class should implement the following functions:
 *
 * @code
 * class Distribution
 * {
 *  public:
 *   // The type of observation used by this distribution.
 *   typedef something DataType;
 *
 *   // Return the probability of the given observation.
 *   double Probability(const DataType& observation) const;
 *
 *   // Estimate the distribution based on the given observations.
 *   double Train(const std::vector<DataType>& observations);
 *
 *   // Estimate the distribution based on the given observations, given also
 *   // the probability of each observation coming from this distribution.
 *   double Train(const std::vector<DataType>& observations,
 *                const std::vector<double>& probabilities);
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * See the DiscreteDistribution class for an example.  One
 * would use the DiscreteDistribution class when the observations are
 * non-negative integers.  Other distributions could be Gaussians, a mixture of
 * Gaussians (GMM), or any other probability distribution implementing the
 * four Distribution functions.
 *
 * Usage of the HMM class generally involves either training an HMM or loading
 * an already-known HMM and taking probability measurements of sequences.
 * Example code for supervised training of a Gaussian HMM (that is, where the
 * emission output distribution is a single Gaussian for each hidden state) is
 * given below.
 *
 * @code
 * extern arma::mat observations; // Each column is an observation.
 * extern arma::Row<size_t> states; // Hidden states for each observation.
 * // Create an untrained HMM with 5 hidden states and default (N(0, 1))
 * // Gaussian distributions with the dimensionality of the dataset.
 * HMM<GaussianDistribution> hmm(5, GaussianDistribution(observations.n_rows));
 *
 * // Train the HMM (the labels could be omitted to perform unsupervised
 * // training).
 * hmm.Train(observations, states);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Once initialized, the HMM can evaluate the probability of a certain sequence
 * (with LogLikelihood()), predict the most likely sequence of hidden states
 * (with Predict()), generate a sequence (with Generate()), or estimate the
 * probabilities of each state for a sequence of observations (with Train()).
 *
 * @tparam Distribution Type of emission distribution for this HMM.
