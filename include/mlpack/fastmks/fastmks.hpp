/**
 * An implementation of fast exact max-kernel search.  Given a query dataset and
 * a reference dataset (or optionally just a reference dataset which is also
 * used as the query dataset), fast exact max-kernel search finds, for each
 * point in the query dataset, the k points in the reference set with maximum
 * kernel value K(p_q, p_r), where k is a specified parameter and K() is a
 * Mercer kernel.
 *
 * For more information, see the following paper.

 * This class allows specification of the type of kernel and also of the type of
 * tree.  FastMKS can be run on kernels that work on arbitrary objects --
 * however, this only works with cover trees and other trees that are built only
 * on points in the dataset (and not centroids of regions or anything like
 * that).
 *
 * @tparam KernelType Type of kernel to run FastMKS with.
 * @tparam MatType Type of data matrix (usually arma::mat).
 * @tparam TreeType Type of tree to run FastMKS with; it must satisfy the
 *     TreeType policy API.
