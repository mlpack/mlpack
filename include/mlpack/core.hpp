/**
 * mlpack is an intuitive, fast, and flexible C++ machine learning library with
 * bindings to other languages.  It is meant to be a machine learning analog to
 * LAPACK, and aims to implement a wide array of machine learning methods and
 * function as a "swiss army knife" for machine learning researchers.  The
 * mlpack website can be found at https://mlpack.org.
 *
 * This documentation is API documentation similar to Javadoc.  It isn't
 * necessarily a tutorial, but it does provide detailed documentation on every
 * namespace, method, and class.
 *
 * Each mlpack namespace generally refers to one machine learning method, so
 * browsing the list of namespaces provides some insight as to the breadth of
 * the methods contained in the library.
 *
 * For the list of contributors to mlpack, see
 * https://www.mlpack.org/community.html.  This library would not be possible
 * without everyone's hard work and contributions!
