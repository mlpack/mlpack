/**
 * The HoeffdingTree object represents all of the necessary information for a
 * Hoeffding-bound-based decision tree.  This class is able to train on samples
 * in streaming settings and batch settings, and perform splits based on the
 * Hoeffding bound.  The Hoeffding tree (also known as the "very fast decision
 * tree" -- VFDT) is described in the following paper:
 *
 * @code
 * @inproceedings{domingos2000mining,
 *     title={{Mining High-Speed Data Streams}},
 *     author={Domingos, P. and Hulten, G.},
 *     year={2000},
 *     booktitle={Proceedings of the Sixth ACM SIGKDD International Conference
 *         on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD '00)},
 *     pages={71--80}
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The class is modular, and takes three template parameters.  The first,
 * FitnessFunction, is the fitness function that should be used to determine
 * whether a split is beneficial; examples might be GiniImpurity or
 * HoeffdingInformationGain.  The NumericSplitType determines how numeric
 * attributes are handled, and the CategoricalSplitType determines how
 * categorical attributes are handled.  As far as the actual splitting goes,
 * the meat of the splitting procedure will be contained in those two classes.
 *
 * @tparam FitnessFunction Fitness function to use.
 * @tparam NumericSplitType Technique for splitting numeric features.
 * @tparam CategoricalSplitType Technique for splitting categorical features.
