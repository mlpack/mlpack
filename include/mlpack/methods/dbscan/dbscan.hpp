 * DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a

 *       databases with noise.},

 *
 * The DBSCAN algorithm iteratively clusters points using range searches with a
 * specified radius parameter.  This implementation allows configuration of the
 * range search technique used and the point selection strategy by means of
 * template parameters.
 *
 * @tparam RangeSearchType Class to use for range searching.
 * @tparam PointSelectionPolicy Strategy for selecting next point to cluster
 *      with.
