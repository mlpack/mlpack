/**
 * Nearest neighbor search with pearson distance (or furthest neighbor search
 * with pearson correlation).
 * Note that, with normalized vectors, neighbor search with pearson distance is
 * equivalent to neighbor search with Euclidean distance. Therefore, instead of
 * performing neighbor search directly with pearson distance, we first normalize
 * all vectors, and then use KNN (i.e. NeighborSearch with Euclidean distance,
 * KDTree). Pearson correlation are calculated from Euclidean distance.
 *
 * An example of how to use PearsonSearch in CF is shown below:
 *
 * @code
 * extern arma::mat data; // data is a (user, item, rating) table.
 * // Users for whom recommendations are generated.
 * extern arma::Col<size_t> users;
 * arma::Mat<size_t> recommendations; // Resulting recommendations.
 *
 * CFType<> cf(data);
 *
 * // Generate 10 recommendations for all users.
 * cf.template GetRecommendations<PearsonSearch>(10, recommendations);
 * @endcode
