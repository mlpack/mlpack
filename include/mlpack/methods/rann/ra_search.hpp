   * Initialize the RASearch object, passing both a reference dataset (this is
   * the dataset that will be searched).  Optionally, perform the computation in
   * naive mode or single-tree mode.  An initialized distance metric can be
   * given, for cases where the distance metric has internal data (i.e. the
   * distance::MahalanobisDistance class).
   *
   * This method will copy the matrices to internal copies, which are rearranged
   * during tree-building.  If you don't need to keep the reference dataset,
   * you can use std::move() to remove the overhead of making copies. Using
   * std::move() transfers the ownership of the dataset.
   *
   * tau, the rank-approximation parameter, specifies that we are looking for k
   * neighbors with probability alpha of being in the top tau percent of nearest
   * neighbors.  So, as an example, if our dataset has 1000 points, and we want
   * 5 nearest neighbors with 95% probability of being in the top 5% of nearest
   * neighbors (or, the top 50 nearest neighbors), we set k = 5, tau = 5, and
   * alpha = 0.95.
   *
   * The method will fail (and throw a std::invalid_argument exception) if the
   * value of tau is too low: tau must be set such that the number of points in
   * the corresponding percentile of the data is greater than k.  Thus, if we
   * choose tau = 0.1 with a dataset of 1000 points and k = 5, then we are
   * attempting to choose 5 nearest neighbors out of the closest 1 point -- this
   * is invalid.
   *
   * @param referenceSet Set of reference points.
   * @param naive If true, the rank-approximate search will be performed by
   *      directly sampling the whole set instead of using the stratified
   *      sampling on the tree.
   * @param singleMode If true, single-tree search will be used (as opposed to
   *      dual-tree search).  This is useful when Search() will be called with
   *      few query points.
   * @param distance An optional instance of the DistanceType class.
   * @param tau The rank-approximation in percentile of the data. The default
   *     value is 5%.
   * @param alpha The desired success probability. The default value is 0.95.
   * @param sampleAtLeaves Sample at leaves for faster but less accurate
   *      computation. This defaults to 'false'.
   * @param firstLeafExact Traverse to the first leaf without approximation.
   *     This can ensure that the query definitely finds its (near) duplicate
   *     if there exists one.  This defaults to 'false' for now.
   * @param singleSampleLimit The limit on the largest node that can be
   *     approximated by sampling. This defaults to 20.
