 * Defines the LSHSearch class, which performs an approximate
 * nearest neighbor search for a queries in a query set
 * over a given dataset using Locality-sensitive hashing
 * with 2-stable distributions.
 *
 * The details of this method can be found in the following paper:
 *
 * @code

 *      {Proceedings of the 12th Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry},
 *  pages={253--262},
 *  year={2004},
 *  organization={ACM}
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Additionally, the class implements Multiprobe LSH, which improves
 * approximation results during the search for approximate nearest neighbors.
 * The Multiprobe LSH algorithm was presented in the paper:
