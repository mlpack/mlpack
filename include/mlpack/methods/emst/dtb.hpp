/**
 * Performs the MST calculation using the Dual-Tree Boruvka algorithm, using any

 * General usage of this class might be like this:
 *
 * @code
 * extern arma::mat data; // We want to find the MST of this dataset.
 * DualTreeBoruvka<> dtb(data); // Create the tree with default options.
 *
 * // Find the MST.
 * arma::mat mstResults;
 * dtb.ComputeMST(mstResults);
 * @endcode
 *
 * More advanced usage of the class can use different types of trees, pass in an
 * already-built tree, or compute the MST using the O(n^2) naive algorithm.
 *
 * @tparam DistanceType The distance metric to use.
 * @tparam MatType The type of data matrix to use.
 * @tparam TreeType Type of tree to use.  This should follow the TreeType policy
 *      API.
