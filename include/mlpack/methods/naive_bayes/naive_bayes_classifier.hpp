/**
 * The simple Naive Bayes classifier.  This class trains on the data by
 * calculating the sample mean and variance of the features with respect to each
 * of the labels, and also the class probabilities.  The class labels are
 * assumed to be positive integers (starting with 0), and are expected to be the
 * last row of the data input to the constructor.
 *
 * Mathematically, it computes P(X_i = x_i | Y = y_j) for each feature X_i for
 * each of the labels y_j.  Along with this, it also computes the class
 * probabilities P(Y = y_j).
 *
 * For classifying a data point (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n), it computes the following:
 * arg max_y(P(Y = y)*P(X_1 = x_1 | Y = y) * ... * P(X_n = x_n | Y = y))
 *
 * Example use:
 *
 * @code
 * extern arma::mat training_data, testing_data;
 * NaiveBayesClassifier<> nbc(training_data, 5);
 * arma::vec results;
 *
 * nbc.Classify(testing_data, results);
 * @endcode
 *
 * The ModelMatType template parameter specifies the internal matrix type that
 * NaiveBayesClassifier will use to hold the means, variances, and weights that
 * make up the Naive Bayes model.  This can be arma::mat, arma::fmat, or any
 * other Armadillo (or Armadillo-compatible) object.  Because ModelMatType may
 * be different than the type of the data the model is trained on, now training
 * is possible with subviews, sparse matrices, or anything else, while still
 * storing the model as a ModelMatType internally.
 *
 * @tparam ModelMatType Internal matrix type to use to store the model.
