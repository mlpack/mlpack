/**
 * Declaration of the Batch Normalization layer class. The layer transforms
 * the input data into zero mean and unit variance and then scales and shifts
 * the data by parameters, gamma and beta respectively. These parameters are
 * learnt by the network.
 *
 * If deterministic is false (training), the mean and variance over the batch is
 * calculated and the data is normalized. If it is set to true (testing) then
 * the mean and variance accrued over the training set is used.

   * will be 0, and thus every element of the input will have a different
   * normalization applied to it.

   * As an example, if we have a 3-dimensional input (call the
