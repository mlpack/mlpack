/**
 * The HoeffdingNumericSplit class implements the numeric feature splitting
 * strategy alluded to by Domingos and Hulten in the following paper:
 *
 * @code
 * @inproceedings{domingos2000mining,
 *   title={{Mining High-Speed Data Streams}},
 *   author={Domingos, P. and Hulten, G.},
 *   year={2000},
 *   booktitle={Proceedings of the Sixth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on
 *       Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD '00)},
 *   pages={71--80}
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The strategy alluded to is very simple: we discretize the numeric features
 * that we see.  But in this case, we don't know how many bins we have, which
 * makes things a little difficult.  This class only makes binary splits, and
 * has a maximum number of bins.  The binning strategy is simple: the split
 * caches the minimum and maximum value of points seen so far, and when the
 * number of points hits a predefined threshold, the cached minimum-maximum
 * range is equally split into bins, and splitting proceeds in the same way as
 * with the categorical splits.  This is a simple and stupid strategy, so don't
 * expect it to be the best possible thing you can do.
 *
 * @tparam FitnessFunction Fitness function to use for calculating gain.
