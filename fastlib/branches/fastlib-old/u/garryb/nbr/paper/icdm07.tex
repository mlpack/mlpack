   The ABSTRACT is to be in fully-justified italicized text, at the top 
   of the left-hand column, below the author and affiliation 
   information. Use the word ``Abstract'' as the title, in 12-point 
   Times, boldface type, centered relative to the column, initially 
   capitalized. The abstract is to be in 10-point, single-spaced type. 
   The abstract may be up to 3 inches (7.62 cm) long. Leave two blank 
   lines after the Abstract, then begin the main text.

\Section{Introduction}

Please follow the steps outlined below when submitting your 
manuscript to the IEEE Computer Society Press. Note there have 
been some changes to the measurements from previous instructions. 

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\Section{Instructions}

Please read the following carefully.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Language}

All manuscripts must be in English.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Printing your paper}

Print your properly formatted text on high-quality, $8.5 \times 11$-inch 
white printer paper. A4 paper is also acceptable, but please leave the 
extra 0.5 inch (1.27 cm) at the BOTTOM of the page.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Margins and page numbering}

All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be 
kept within a print area 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches 
(22.54 cm) high. Do not write or print anything outside the print area. 
Number your pages lightly, in pencil, on the upper right-hand corners of 
the BACKS of the pages (for example, 1/10, 2/10, or 1 of 10, 2 of 10, and 
so forth). Please do not write on the fronts of the pages, nor on the 
lower halves of the backs of the pages.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\SubSection{Formatting your paper}

All text must be in a two-column format. The total allowable width of 
the text area is 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches (22.54 cm) 
high. Columns are to be 3-1/4 inches (8.25 cm) wide, with a 5/16 inch 
(0.8 cm) space between them. The main title (on the first page) should 
begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge of the page. The second and 
following pages should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge. On 
all pages, the bottom margin should be 1-1/8 inches (2.86 cm) from the 
bottom edge of the page for $8.5 \times 11$-inch paper; for A4 paper, 
approximately 1-5/8 inches (4.13 cm) from the bottom edge of the page.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Type-style and fonts}

Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used. If neither is 
available on your word processor, please use the font closest in 
appearance to Times that you have access to.

MAIN TITLE. Center the title 1-3/8 inches (3.49 cm) from the top edge of 
the first page. The title should be in Times 14-point, boldface type. 
Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and 
adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or 
prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word). Leave two blank 
lines after the title.

AUTHOR NAME(s) and AFFILIATION(s) shall only be printed on the
camera-ready copy and are to be centered beneath the title 
and printed in Times 12-point, non-boldface type. This information is to 
be followed by two blank lines. The submission is double blind and
thus should not identify the authors.

The ABSTRACT and MAIN TEXT are to be in a two-column format. 

MAIN TEXT. Type main text in 10-point Times, single-spaced. Do NOT use 
double-spacing. All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx. 1/6 
inch or 0.422 cm). Make sure your text is fully justified---that is, 
flush left and flush right. Please do not place any additional blank 
lines between paragraphs. Figure and table captions should be 10-point 
Helvetica boldface type as in
\begin{figure}[h]
   \caption{Example of caption.}
\end{figure}

\noindent Long captions should be set as in 
\begin{figure}[h] 
   \caption{Example of long caption requiring more than one line. It is 
     not typed centered but aligned on both sides and indented with an 
     additional margin on both sides of 1~pica.}
\end{figure}

\noindent Callouts should be 9-point Helvetica, non-boldface type. 
Initially capitalize only the first word of section titles and first-, 
second-, and third-order headings.

FIRST-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, {\large \bf 1. Introduction}) 
should be Times 12-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, 
with one blank line before, and one blank line after.

SECOND-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, {\elvbf 1.1. Database elements}) 
should be Times 11-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, 
with one blank line before, and one after. If you require a third-order 
heading (we discourage it), use 10-point Times, boldface, initially 
capitalized, flush left, preceded by one blank line, followed by a period 
and your text on the same line.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Footnotes}

Please use footnotes sparingly%
\footnote
   {%
     Or, better still, try to avoid footnotes altogether.  To help your 
     readers, avoid using footnotes altogether and include necessary 
     peripheral observations in the text (within parentheses, if you 
     prefer, as in this sentence).
   }
and place them at the bottom of the column on the page on which they are 
referenced. Use Times 8-point type, single-spaced.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{References}

List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times, 
single-spaced, at the end of your paper. When referenced in the text, 
enclose the citation number in square brackets, for example~\cite{ex1}. 
Where appropriate, include the name(s) of editors of referenced books.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}

All graphics should be centered. Your artwork must be in place in the 
article (preferably printed as part of the text rather than pasted up). 
If you are using photographs and are able to have halftones made at a 
print shop, use a 100- or 110-line screen. If you must use plain photos, 
they must be pasted onto your manuscript. Use rubber cement to affix the 
images in place. Black and white, clear, glossy-finish photos are 
preferable to color. Supply the best quality photographs and 
illustrations possible. Penciled lines and very fine lines do not 
reproduce well. Remember, the quality of the book cannot be better than 
the originals provided. Do NOT use tape on your pages!

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Color}

The use of color on interior pages (that is, pages other
than the cover) is prohibitively expensive. We publish interior pages in 
color only when it is specifically requested and budgeted for by the 
conference organizers. DO NOT SUBMIT COLOR IMAGES IN YOUR 
PAPERS UNLESS SPECIFICALLY INSTRUCTED TO DO SO.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Symbols}

If your word processor or typewriter cannot produce Greek letters, 
mathematical symbols, or other graphical elements, please use 
pressure-sensitive (self-adhesive) rub-on symbols or letters (available 
in most stationery stores, art stores, or graphics shops).

%------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\SubSection{Copyright forms}

You must include your signed IEEE copyright release form when you submit 
your finished paper. We MUST have this form before your paper can be 
published in the proceedings.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Conclusions}

Please direct any questions to the production editor in charge of these 
proceedings at the IEEE Computer Society Press: Phone (714) 821-8380, or 
Fax (714) 761-1784.
