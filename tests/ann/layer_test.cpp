/**
 * @file layer_test.cpp
 * @author Ryan Curtin
 *
 * This file includes all tests in ann/layer/, which are split up by layer for
 * organization.  However, compiling each test individually results in a huge
 * amount of compilation overhead; including them all here into one file reduces
 * compilation time and memory usage.
 *
 * It's possible that this could be avoided by smart use of extern template
 * instantiations.
