The reason is the mathematical languages we employ have few forms of expression. We define more expressive languages, first for dynamical discrete-continuous systems, and then more rigorously for mathematical programs (MP). Our approach provides theoretical basis for designing MP software.The first framework we define is called linear coupled component automata (LCCA). It supports finite domain constraints, explicitly handles dynamics, and enforces modular modeling. We show how LCCA models can be mechanically converted into mathematical programming (MP) constraints. Currently, chemical process systems are usually modeled directly with MP constraints. We show with an example that it is much easier to model hybrid systems in our LCCA framework.We then pursue a more rigorous approach for the MP part of our work, for the purposes of providing a computer implementation of an MP framework. There are two main results: a rich computer language for declaring MPs and automation of certain model transformations. Mathematically, these correspond to defining a set $p$ of MPs and defining a binary relation on $p$.The set $p$ contains programs as one would want to write in practice, not just canonical matrix forms. Complex index sets can be defined in intuitive ways, and they are first-class entities in our theory, not mere notational conveniences eliminated at parse time. This has many benefits: it retains knowledge of the problem structure, keeps the program size to a minimum, and speeds up certain operations. Our definition of the semantics elucidates the nature of MP algorithms and explains the information sought from a solution.The binary relation on programs $p$ can be defined because a logical formulation allows treating constraints and programs as mathematical objects. Principally, our definition includes: a procedure for putting Boolean expressions into conjunctive normal form, and a procedure for converting disjunctive constraints into mixed-integer inequalities. Neither has been defined previously for a language as expressive as ours, and the latter has not been defined as a formal mapping on constraint spaces. Overall this leads to a procedure for converting general MPs to pure mixed-integer programs (MIPs).Sets and set relations are defined using the methods of type theory, which espouses a close relation between mathematics and computation. As a result, the set $p$ can be viewed simultaneously as a novel definition of MP and as the software architecture for implementing an MP language. Similarly, the binary relation on $p$ can be directly implemented on a computer. Several examples of our software's input and output are provided.}, Year = {2006} }@article{Agarwal2007DAM,   Author = {Agarwal, Ashish and Grossmann, Ignacio E.},   Title = {Automating Mathematical Program Transformations},   Journal = {Discrete Applied Mathematics},   Volume = {x},   Number = {x},   Pages = {pp-pp},   Note = {Submitted Dec 2006.

There is a pressing need for methods for finding overlapping sequence intervals that are highly scalable to database size, query interval size, result size and construction/updating of the interval database. RESULTS: We have developed a new interval database representation, the Nested Containment List (NCList), whose query time is O(n + log N), where N is the database size and n is the size of the result set. In all cases tested, this query algorithm is 5-500-fold faster than other indexing methods tested in this study, such as MySQL multi-column indexing, MySQL binning and R-Tree indexing. We provide performance comparisons both in simulated datasets and real-world genome alignment databases, across a wide range of database sizes and query interval widths. We also present an in-place NCList construction algorithm that yields database construction times that are approximately 100-fold faster than other methods available.

We show how to formulate dimensions and units as classes in a nominally typed object-oriented language through the use of statically typed metaclasses. Our formulation allows both parametric and inheritance polymorphism with respect to both dimension and unit types. It also allows for integration of encapsulated measurement systems, dynamic conversion factors, declarations of scales (including nonlinear scales) with defined zeros, and nonconstant exponents on dimension types.

Usually, numerical solutions (traces or trajectories) for appropriate initial conditions are analyzed in order to infer significant properties of the biological systems under study. When several variables are involved and the traces span over a long interval of time, the analysis phase necessitates automation in a scalable and efficient manner. Earlier, we have advocated and experimented with the use of automata and temporal logics for this purpose (XS-systems and Simpathica) and here we continue our investigation more deeply. We propose the use of hybrid automata and we discuss the use of the notions of bisimulation and collapsing for a "qualitative" analysis of the temporal evolution of biological systems. As compared with our previous approach, hybrid automata allow maintenance of more information about the differential equations (S-system) than standard automata. The use of the notion of bisimulation in the definition of the projection operation (restrictions to a subset of "interesting" variables) makes it possible to work with reduced automata satisfying the same formulae as the initial ones. Finally, the notion of collapsing is introduced to move toward still simpler and equivalent automaton taming the complexity in terms of states whose number depends on the attained level of approximation.

A particularly striking example is represented by several members of the zig gene family, which code for secreted immunoglobulin domain proteins required for maintaining ventral nerve cord organization in Caenorhabditis elegans. These genes are coordinately expressed in a single interneuron in the ventral nerve cord, known as PVT. Their expression is initiated at a precise postembryonic stage, long after PVT has been generated in mid-embryogenesis. We define spatial and temporal cues that are required for the precise regulation of zig gene expression. We find that two LIM homeobox genes, the Lhx3-class gene ceh-14 and the Lmx-class gene lim-6 are coordinately required for zig gene expression in PVT. Temporal control of zig gene expression is conferred by the heterochronic gene lin-14, a nuclear factor previously implicated in developmental timing in various contexts. Loss of the lim-6 and ceh-14 transcription factors and the developmental timer lin-14 cause not only a loss of zig gene expression but also lead to defects in the maintenance of ventral nerve cord architecture. Overriding the normal spatiotemporal control of zig gene expression through expression of one of the zig genes under control of heterologous promoters also causes axon patterning defects in the ventral nerve cord.

Using ubiquitously expressed histone-GFP fusion protein to label cells/nuclei and a confocal microscope, the imaging protocol captures embryogenesis at high spatial (31 planes at 1 microm apart) and temporal (every minute) resolution without apparent effects on development. A set of image analysis algorithms then automatically recognizes cells at each time point, tracks cell movements, divisions and deaths over time and assigns cell identities based on the canonical naming scheme. Starting from the four-cell stage (or earlier), our software, named starrynite, can trace the lineage up to the 350-cell stage in 25 min on a desktop computer.

Process simulation is therefore a combined discrete/continuous simulation problem. In addition, there is a critical need for a declarative process modeling environment to encompass the entire range of processing system operation, from purely continuous to batch. These issues are addressed by this article.A new formal mathematical description of the combined discrete/continuous simulation problem is introduced to enhance the understanding of the fundamental discrete changes required to model processing systems. The modeling task is decomposed into two distinct activities: modeling fundamental physical behavior, and modeling the external actions imposed on this physical system. Both require significant discrete components.

The most intriguing class of problems are those in which the optimal trajectories are characterized by a sequence of switches and/or jumps at events, some of which are dependent on the state of the system satisfying certain conditions (state or implicit events), and it is necessary to search over several alternative sequences of events to find the optimal one. The potential for numerical optimization procedures to make optimal sequencing decisions in hybrid dynamic systems is explored. A general formulation of the hybrid optimal control problem is presented. Novel existence and uniqueness results for the parametric sensitivity functions of a hybrid system show that parameter optimization of hybrid dynamic systems (including sequencing decisions) is in general nonsmooth, but also smooth in many important cases.

An important conceptualization is the module, which is loosely defined as a cohort of proteins that perform a dedicated cellular task. Based on a computational analysis of limited interaction datasets in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it has been suggested that the global protein interaction network is segregated such that highly connected proteins, called hubs, tend not to link to each other. Moreover, it has been suggested that hubs fall into two distinct classes: "party" hubs are co-expressed and co-localized with their partners, whereas "date" hubs interact with incoherently expressed and diversely localized partners, and thereby cohere disparate parts of the global network. This structure may be compared with altocumulus clouds, i.e., cotton ball-like structures sparsely connected by thin wisps. However, this organization might reflect a small and/or biased sample set of interactions. In a multi-validated high-confidence (HC) interaction network, assembled from all extant S. cerevisiae interaction data, including recently available proteome-wide interaction data and a large set of reliable literature-derived interactions, we find that hub-hub interactions are not suppressed. In fact, the number of interactions a hub has with other hubs is a good predictor of whether a hub protein is essential or not. We find that date hubs are neither required for network tolerance to node deletion, nor do date hubs have distinct biological attributes compared to other hubs. Date and party hubs do not, for example, evolve at different rates. Our analysis suggests that the organization of global protein interaction network is highly interconnected and hence interdependent, more like the continuous dense aggregations of stratus clouds than the segregated configuration of altocumulus clouds. If the network is configured in a stratus format, cross-talk between proteins is potentially a major source of noise. In turn, control of the activity of the most highly connected proteins may be vital. Indeed, we find that a fluctuation in steady-state levels of the most connected proteins is minimized.}, Keywords = {saccharomyces-cerevisiae; functional modules; complex networks;building-blocks; budding yeast; database; identification; evolutionary;modularity; artifacts},   Year = {2006} }@inproceedings{Behrmann2001,   Author = {Behrmann, G. and Fehnker, A. and Hune, T. and Larsen, K. and Pettersson, P. and Romijn, J. and Vaandrager, F.},   Title = {Minimum-cost reachability for priced timed automata},   BookTitle = {Proceedings of Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control. 4th International Workshop, HSCC 2001.},   Editor = {Domenica, M.

The other approach is to hierarchically-decompose the problem into a planning level problem and a scheduling level problem. This approach leads to tractable problems. Neither of these approaches provide the framework for incorporating uncertainties in the processing time of batches, or random equipment breakdowns, or demand uncertainties in the future. Furthermore, these approaches only provide `one snapshot' of the planning problem and not a `walk through the timeline'. Model predictive planning and scheduling provides a framework for studying dynamics. Model predictive planning and scheduling requires a forecasting model and an optimization model. Both these models work in tandem in a simulation environment that incorporates uncertainty. The similarity with the model predictive approach which is widely used in process-control is that in each period, the forecasting model calculates the target inventory in the future periods.

We compare a traditional information policy that does not use shared information with a full information policy that does exploit shared information. in a numerical study we find that supply chain costs are 2.2% lower on average with the full information policy than with the traditional information policy, and the maximum difference is 12.1%.

The cost difference between the traditional information policy and the lower bound is an upper bound on the value of information sharing: Ln the same study, that difference is 3.4% on average, and no more than 13.8%. We contrast the value of information sharing with two other benefits of information technology, faster and cheaper order processing, which lead to shorter lead times and smaller batch sizes, respectively. In our sample, cutting lead times nearly in half reduces costs by 21% on average, and cutting batches in half reduces costs by 22% on average.

The optimal cycle time is then determined by solving a sequence of fixed cycle time problems.

For universal specifications, positive verification for a QTS implies the specification is true for the infinite-state transition system. Since in most applications exact reachability mappings required to compute the QTS cannot be represented or computed, we introduce the approximate quotient transition system (AQTS). The AQTS is an approximation to the QTS obtained from a conservative approximation to the reachability mapping.

An AQTS bisimulation is essentially equivalent to the infinite-state system for the purposes of verification.

Therefore, the use of the AQTS for verification of universal specifications is proposed and illustrated with an example.

This paper proposes an extension of MSCs, which we call live sequence charts (or LSCs), since our main extension deals with specifying "liveness", i.e., things that must occur. In fact, LSCs allow the distinction between possible and necessary behavior both globally, on the level of an entire chart and locally, when specifying events, conditions and progress over time within a chart.

However, pathway analysis of large and highly entangled metabolic networks meets the problem of combinatorial explosion of possible routes across the networks. Here we propose a method for coping with this problem by suitably classifying metabolites as external or internal. External metabolites are considered to have buffered concentrations while internal metabolites have to fulfil a balance condition at steady state. For many substances such as nutrients and excreted products, there are biochemical reasons to classify them as external. In addition. other substances (especially at central branching points) can operationally be considered external in order to avoid combinatorial explosion. We suggest to find such a classification of metabolites that minimizes the number of elementary flux modes (pathways). This is motivated by the objectives of finding such a description of the system that reduces as much as possible the amount of necessary data and of removing the ambiguity and arbitrariness in the classification of metabolites in an automated, systematic way. For networks of moderate size, the solution to this combinatorial minimization problem can be found by exhaustive search.

A, more comprehensive example, the lactose operon, is also developed, bringing some confidence in the formalism considered as a modeling language. Then a finer-grained concurrent model, the mk-calculus, is considered, where interactions have to be at most binary. We show how to embed the coarser-grained language in the latter, a property which we call self-assembly.

Automatic methods have always been considered less reliable than human expertise. This is illustrated in the EGASP project, where reference annotations against which all automatic methods are measured are generated by human annotators and experimentally verified. We hypothesized that replicating the accuracy of human annotators in an automatic method could be achieved by formalizing the rules and decisions that they use, in a mathematical formalism. RESULTS: We have developed Exogean, a flexible framework based on directed acyclic colored multigraphs (DACMs) that can represent biological objects (for example, mRNA, ESTs, protein alignments, exons) and relationships between them. Graphs are analyzed to process the information according to rules that replicate those used by human annotators. Simple individual starting objects given as input to Exogean are thus combined and synthesized into complex objects such as protein coding transcripts. CONCLUSION: We show here, in the context of the EGASP project, that Exogean is currently the method that best reproduces protein coding gene annotations from human experts, in terms of identifying at least one exact coding sequence per gene.

In particular, we address convex nonlinear formulations involving (i) 0-1 integer variables and (ii) uncertain parameters appearing linearly and separately and present on the right-hand side of the constraints. The developments reported in this work are based upon decomposition principles where the problem is decomposed into two iteratively converging subproblems: (i) a primal and (ii) a master subproblem, representing valid parametric upper and lower bounds on the final solution, respectively. The primal subproblem is formulated by fixing the integer variables which results in a multiparametric nonlinear programming (mp-NLP) problem, which is solved by outer-approximating the nonlinear functions at a number of points in the space of uncertain parameters to derive linear profiles. The aim of the master subproblem is then to propose another set of integer solutions which are better than the integer solutions that have already been analyzed in the primal subproblem. This can be achieved by (i) introducing cuts, (ii) employing outer-approximation (OA) principles, or (iii) using generalized benders decomposition (GBD) fundamentals.

We present powerful simulation environments that have been developed in recent years. 2) Validation of plant instrumentation and discrete controllers.

Techniques for the verification of discrete controllers for continuous processes are discussed, which are based on a discrete approximation of the continuous dynamics. 3) Scheduling of batch plants. for plants that are operated in a discontinuous fashion, the timing and sequencing of the operations are very important for the efficient use of the equipment. this leads to large mixed-integer optimization problems.

The fates of the six vulval precursor cells are specified by the combined action of an inductive signal that activates the EGF receptor mitogen-activated PK signaling pathway (specifying a primary fate) and a lateral signal mediated by LIN-12/Notch (specifying a secondary fate). Here we use methods devised for the engineering of complex reactive systems to model a biological system.

Our model also suggests the existence of an additional mechanism operating during lateral specification that prohibits neighboring vulval precursor cells from assuming the primary fate.}, Keywords = {computational modeling; statecharts; LIN-12/Notchc-elegans; precursor cells; lin-12/notch; fates; statecharts;inhibition; induction; pathways; pattern; signal},   Year = {2005} }@article{Fisher2007,   Author = {Fisher, J. and Piterman, N. and Hajnal, A. and Henzinger, T.

Although many genes controlling vulval cell fate specification have been identified, how they orchestrate themselves to generate a robust and invariant pattern of cell fates is not yet completely understood. Here, we have developed a dynamic computational model incorporating the current mechanistic understanding of gene interactions during this patterning process. A key feature of our model is the inclusion of multiple modes of crosstalk between the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and LIN-12/Notch signaling pathways, which together determine the fates of the six vulval precursor cells (VPCs). Computational analysis, using the model-checking technique, provides new biological insights into the regulatory network governing VPC fate specification and predicts novel negative feedback loops. In addition, our analysis shows that most mutations affecting vulval development lead to stable fate patterns in spite of variations in synchronicity between VPCs. Computational searches for the basis of this robustness show that a sequential activation of the EGFR-mediated inductive signaling and LIN-12 / Notch-mediated lateral signaling pathways is key to achieve a stable cell fate pattern. We demonstrate experimentally a time-delay between the activation of the inductive and lateral signaling pathways in wild-type animals and the loss of sequential signaling in mutants showing unstable fate patterns; thus, validating two key predictions provided by our modeling work. The insights gained by our modeling study further substantiate the usefulness of executing and analyzing mechanistic models to investigate complex biological behaviors.}, Year = {2007} }@book{Flanagan2002,   Author = {Flanagan, David},   Title = {JavaScript: the definitive guide},   Publisher = {O'Reilly},   Address = {Sebastopol, CA},   Edition = {4th}, Keywords = {JavaScript (Computer program language)Web servers.Object-oriented programming (Computer science)Programming Languages -- Handbooks.COMPUTER PROGRAMMING.COMPUTER PROGRAMS.PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES.OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING.ALGORITHMS.FILE MAINTENANCE (COMPUTERS)SOFTWARE TOOLS.},   Year = {2002} }@book{Fogiel1991,   Author = {Fogiel, M.},   Title = {The Physical chemistry problem solver: a complete solution guide to any textbook},   Publisher = {Research and Education Association},   Address = {Piscataway, N.J.},   Series = {REA's problem solvers},   Note = {Corp Author: Research and Education Association.

As such, the theory must assume the prior existence of these entities. This existence problem was recognized nearly a century ago, when DeVries (1904, Species and Varieties: Their Origin by Mutation) stated, ''Natural selection may explain the survival of the fittest, but it cannot explain the arrival of the fittest.'' At the heart of the existence problem is determining how biological organizations arise in ontogeny and in phylogeny. We develop a minimal theory of biological organization based on two abstractions from chemistry. The theory is formulated using lambda-calculus, which provides a natural framework capturing (i) the constructive feature of chemistry, that the collision of molecules generates specific new molecules, and (ii) chemistry's diversity of equivalence classes, that many different reactants can yield the same stable product. We employ a well-stirred and constrained stochastic flow reactor to explore the generic behavior of large numbers of applicatively interacting lambda-expressions. This constructive dynamical system generates fixed systems of transformation characterized by syntactical and functional invariances. Organizations are recognized and defined by these syntactical and functional regularities. Objects retained within an organization realize an algebraic structure and possess a grammar which is invariant under the interaction between objects. An organization is self-maintaining, and is characterized by (i) boundaries established by the invariances, (ii) strong self-repair capabilities responsible for a robustness to perturbation, and (iii) a center, defined as the smallest kinetically persistent and self-maintaining generator set of the algebra. Imposition of different boundary conditions on the stochastic flow reactor generates different levels of organization, and a diversity of organizations within each level. Level 0 is defined by self-copying objects or simple ensembles of copying objects. Level 1 denotes a new object class, whose objects are self-maintaining organizations made of Level 0 objects, and Level 2 is defined by self-maintaining metaorganizations composed of Level 1 organizations. These results invite analogy to the history of life, that is, to the progression from self-replication to self-maintaining procaryotic organizations to ultimately yield self-maintaining eucaryotic organizations. In our system self-maintaining organizations arise as a generic consequence of two features of chemistry, without appeal to natural selection.

In contrast to other general purpose mathematical programming methods, this innovative approach is designed to cope with the specificities of a process system: it represents the structure of a process system by a unique bipartite graph, termed a P-graph, and captures not only the syntactic but also the semantic contents of the process system. An axiom system underlying the approach has been constructed to define the combinatorially feasible process structures. This axiom system is based on a given set of specifications for the process synthesis problem. Such specifications include the types of operating units and the raw materials, products, by-products, and a variety of waste associated with these operating units. All feasible structures of the process system are embedded in the maximal structure, from which individual solution-structures can be extracted subject to various technical, environmental, economic, and societal constraints. Various theorems have been derived from the axiom system to ensure that this approach is mathematically rigorous, thereby rendering it possible to develop efficient process synthesis methods on the basis of a rigorous mathematical foundation.

In the past, organisations have focused on making effective decisions within a department or section of a company because their functions could be easily de-coupled and this made analysis simpler. However, ignoring the component dependencies for the sake of simplicity can have costly consequences for the company and other organisations outside on the market. Today there are still a number of reasons that hinder the development of fully integrated business processes, as for example the lack of understanding of the complexity of the organisations and the high cost of acquiring and translating organisational and engineering data. The economic advantage of studying and improving these issues is considerable. This contribution describes an on-going effort in developing an integrated framework for supporting supply chain management of process industries. Retailers, warehouses, plants and raw material suppliers are modelled as a network of co-operative agents, each performing one or more supply chain functions. Interactions between agents are made through the common agent communication language knowledge query message language (KQML) and data is modelled using standard exchange of product model data (STEP).

A number of event points is prepostulated, which is the same for all tasks in the process. Event times are defined by the ends of task execution, and they are generally different for different tasks of the process, giving rise to a nonuniform time grid. The necessary time monotonicity for single tasks is guaranteed by means of simple duration constraints. Suitable sequencing constraints, applicable to batch tasks involving the same state, are also introduced, so that state balances are properly posed in the context of the nonuniform time grid. The expression of duration and sequencing constraints is greatly simplified by hiding all unit information within the task data. Three benchmark problems are used to illustrate the efficiency and applicability of the new formulation.

Our assumptions allow us to capture the stochastic nature of the problem and formulate it as a deterministic optimization. As a partial validation of the model, we describe its successful application by product flow teams at Eastman Kodak. We discuss how these flow teams have used the model to reduce finished goods inventory, target cycle time reduction efforts, and determine component inventories.

Early embryogenesis, including processes such as cell division and establishment of cellular polarity, is readily amenable to large-scale functional analysis. A first step toward a system-level understanding is to provide 'first-draft' models both of the molecular assemblies involved(1) and of the functional connections between them. Here we show that such models can be derived from an integrated gene/protein network generated from three different types of functional relationship(2): protein interaction(3), expression profiling similarity(4) and phenotypic profiling similarity(5), as estimated from detailed early embryonic RNA interference phenotypes systematically recorded for hundreds of early embryogenesis genes(6).

We take the first steps towards such an integrated. theory by presenting a recipe for the construction of continuous programming languages - languages in which state dynamics can be described by differential equations. The basic idea is to start with an untimed language and extend it uniformly over dense (real) time. We present a concrete mathematical model and language (the Hybrid concurrent constraint programming model, Hybrid cc) instantiating these ideas. The language is intended to be used for modeling and programming hybrid systems. The language is declarative - programs can be understood as formulas that place constraints on the (temporal) evolution of the system, with parallel composition regarded as conjunction. It is expressive - it allows the definition of continuous versions of the preemption control constructs. The language is obtained by extending the general-purpose computational formalism of (default) concurrent constraint programming (Default cc) with a single temporal construct, called hence - hence A is read as asserting that A holds continuously beyond the current instant. Various patterns of temporal activity can be generated from this single construct by use of the other combinators in Default cc. We provide a precise operational semantics according to which execution alternates between (i) points at which discontinuous change can occur, and (ii) open intervals in which the state of the system changes continuously. Transitions from a state of continuous evolution are triggered when some condition starts or stops holding. We show that the denotational semantics is correct for reasoning about the operational semantics, through an adequacy theorem.

A chance constraint programming approach in conjunction with a two-stage stochastic programming methodology is utilized for capturing the trade-off between customer demand satisfaction (CDS) and production costs. In the proposed model, the production decisions are made before demand realization while the supply chain decisions are delayed. The challenge associated with obtaining the second stage recourse function is resolved by first obtaining a closed-form solution of the inner optimization problem using linear programming duality followed by expectation evaluation by analytical integration. In addition, analytical expressions for the mean and standard deviation of the inventory are derived and used for setting the appropriate CDS levels in the supply chain. A three-site example supply chain is studied within the proposed framework for providing quantitative guidelines for setting customer satisfaction levels and uncovering effective inventory management options. Results indicate that significant improvement in guaranteed service levels can be obtained for a small increase in the total cost. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We consider a nonregular optimization criterion based on due dates which are not a priori given but can be fixed by a decision-maker. A due date assignment cost is included into the objective function. For this type of problems, we generalize well-known approaches for the heuristic solution of classical problems and propose constructive algorithms based on job insertion techniques and iterative algorithms based on local search.

A link between the potential scale-free topology of interactome networks and genetic robustness(3,4) seems to exist, because knockouts of yeast genes(5,6) encoding hubs are approximately threefold more likely to confer lethality than those of non-hubs(1). Here we investigate how hubs might contribute to robustness and other cellular properties for protein protein interactions dynamically regulated both in time and in space. We uncovered two types of hub: 'party' hubs, which interact with most of their partners simultaneously, and 'date' hubs, which bind their different partners at different times or locations. Both in silico studies of network connectivity and genetic interactions described in vivo support a model of organized modularity in which date hubs organize the proteome, connecting biological processes-or modules(7)-to each other, whereas party hubs function inside modules.}, Keywords = {saccharomyces-cerevisiae genome; scale data; identification;robustness; mutations; complexes; database; screens; genes; map},   Year = {2004} }@article{Hangos2001a,   Author = {Hangos, K.

Modelling assumptions form the fundamental basis for the mathematical description of a process system. These assumptions can be translated into either additional mathematical relationships or constraints between model variables, equations, balance volumes or parameters. In order to analyse the effect of modelling assumptions in a formal, rigorous way, a syntax of modelling assumptions has been defined. The smallest indivisible syntactical element, the so called assumption atom has been identified as a triplet. With this syntax a modelling assumption can be described as an elementary assumption, i.e. an assumption consisting of only an assumption atom or a composite assumption consisting of a conjunction of elementary assumptions. The above syntax of modelling assumptions enables us to represent modelling assumptions as transformations acting on the set of model equations. The notion of syntactical correctness and semantical consistency of sets of modelling assumptions is defined and necessary conditions for checking them are given. These transformations can be used in several ways and their implications can be analysed by formal methods. The modelling assumptions define model hierarchies. That is, a series of model families each belonging to a particular equivalence class. These model equivalence classes can be related to primal assumptions regarding the definition of mass, energy and momentum balance volumes and to secondary and tiertinary assumptions regarding the presence or absence and the form of mechanisms within the system. Within equivalence classes, there are many model members, these being related to algebraic model transformations for the particular model. We show how these model hierarchies are driven by the underlying assumption structure and indicate some implications on system dynamics and complexity issues. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Our model includes fixed (possibly joint) and variable replenishment costs, fixed and variable transshipment costs, as well as holding costs for each location and transshipment costs between locations. The problem is to determine how much to replenish and how much to transship each period; thus this work can be viewed as a synthesis of transshipment problems in a static stochastic setting and multilocation dynamic deterministic lot sizing problems. We provide interesting structural properties of optimal policies which enhance our understanding of the important issues which motivate transshipments and allow us to develop an efficient polynomial time algorithm for obtaining the optimal strategy. By exploring the reasons for using transshipments. we enable practitioners to envision the sources of savings from using this strategy and therefore motivate them to incorporate it into their replenishment strategies.

Rules encode an understanding of how a system works in terms of the biomolecules in the system and their possible states and interactions. A set of rules can be as easy to read as a diagrammatic interaction map, but unlike most such maps, rules have precise interpretations. Rules can be processed to automatically generate a mathematical or computational model for a system, which enables explanatory and predictive insights into the system's behavior. Rules are independent units of a model specification that facilitate model revision. Instead of changing a large number of equations or lines of code, as may be required in the case of a conventional mathematical model, a protein interaction can be introduced or modified simply by adding or changing a single rule that represents the interaction of interest. Rules can be defined and visualized by using graphs, so no specialized training in mathematics or computer science is necessary to create models or to take advantage of the representational precision of rules. Rules can be encoded in a machine-readable format to enable electronic storage and exchange of models, as well as basic knowledge about protein-protein interactions.

The control parameterization approach generally results in a comparatively smaller nonlinear program (NLP) but has difficulties in dealing with the path constraints. The advantage of the simultaneous approach lies in its ability to handle path constraints, thus eliminating the need to obtain expensive and possibly infeasible intermediate solutions. The disadvantage is that it requires solution of a potentially very large dimensional NLP. This work presents a decomposition strategy, which combines the advantages of the control parameterization and simultaneous approaches for solving dynamic optimization problems with path constraints. Using the proposed strategy, first the set of state variables x is divided into two sets x(1) and x(2), and the system is partitioned into two corresponding sub-systems. The criterion used to partition the state variables and the system model are that the equations which define the state variables involved in the path constraints should be in the same sub-system. For the resulting sub-systems, one is enforced in the master NLP through collocation method as in simultaneous approach, the other is solved together with the sensitivities in a differential and algebraic equations (DAE) solver. This strategy constitutes a general approach in the sense that for problems with a specific structure the method is equivalent to the control parameterization method, while for other problems with special structures the approach is the same as the simultaneous approach. In general it possesses the advantage of the simultaneous method in handling the path constraints since it is directly enforced in the master NLP as well as the advantage of control parameterization in resulting a small master NLP because only a fraction of the state variables are directly discretized. The method is demonstrated through several numerical examples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This generates a huge number of binary variables and, as a consequence, much time is required for solutions. This study proposes a novel formulation that replaces the tetra-index binary variables by one set of tri-index binary variables (order, order, stage) without losing the model's generality. By the elimination of the unit index, the new formulation requires considerably fewer binary variables, thus significantly shortening the solution time. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Spatial decomposition is based on the idea of dualizing interconnection constraints between the plants and markets in order to be able to optimize each site and market individually. For the temporal decomposition, the interconnection constraints are defined between each time period through the inventory variables so that the entire production and distribution plan can be optimized independently in each time period.

This framework not only subsumes that of logic programming, but satisfies the core properties of logic programs more naturally. From a users point of view, CLP programs have great expressive power due to the constraints which they naturally manipulate. Intuition in the reasoning about programs is enhanced as a result of working directly in the intended domain of discourse. This constrasts with working in the Herbrand Universe wherein every semantic object has to be explicitly coded into a Herbrand term; this enforces reasoning at a primitive level.

The domain of computation R of this particular instance is the algebraic structure consisting of uninterpreted functors over real numbers.

For example, the constraint solver must be incremental in the sense that solving additional constraints must not entail the resolving of old constraints. In our system, constraints are filtered through an inference engine, an engine/solver interface, an equation solver and an inequality solver This sequence of modules reflects a classification and prioritization of the classes of constraints.

This class of problems is formulated as a hybrid MILP/CP model that involves some of the MILP constraints, a reduced set of the CP constraints, and equivalence relations between the MILP and the CP variables. A MILP/CP based decomposition method and an LP/CP-based branch-and-bound algorithm are proposed to solve these hybrid models.

An application example is considered in which the least-cost schedule has to be derived for processing a set of orders with release and due dates using a set of dissimilar parallel machines. It is shown that this problem can be modeled as an MILP, a CP, a combined MILP-CP OPL model (Van Hentenryck, 1999), and a hybrid MILP/CP model.

Unfortunately, usual input facilities are limited, difficult to use, and often are lax about checking their inputs for validity.Yacc provides a general tool for describing the input to a computer program. The Yacc user specifies the structures of his input, together with code to be invoked as each such structure is recognized. Yacc turns such a specification into a subroutine that handles the input process; frequently, it is convenient and appropriate to have most of the flow of control in the users application handled by this subroutine.The input subroutine produced by Yacc calls a user-supplied routine to return the next basic input item. Thus, the user can specify his input in terms of individual input characters, or in terms of higher level constructs such as names and numbers. Theuser-supplied routine may also handle idiomatic features such as comment and continuation conventions, which typically defy easy grammatical specification.Yacc is written in portable C. The class of specifications accepted is a very general one: LALR(1) grammars with disambiguating rules.

Two initially equivalent cells interact via the receptor LIN-12 and its ligand LAG-2, so that one becomes the AC and the other a VU. During this interaction, feedback loops amplify a small difference in lin-12 activity, limiting lin-12 transcription to the presumptive VU and lag-2 transcription to the presumptive AC. Here, we find that hlh-2 appears to be required for the VU fate and directly activates lag-2 transcription in the presumptive AC. HLH-2 appears to accumulate selectively in the presumptive AC prior to differential transcription of lin-12 or lag-2, and is therefore the earliest detectable difference between the two cells undergoing the AC/VU decision. The restricted accumulation of HLH-2 to the presumptive AC reflects post-transcriptional down-regulation of HLH-2 in the presumptive VU. Our observations suggest that hlh-2 is regulated as part of the negative feedback that down-regulates lag-2 transcription in the presumptive VU. Finally, we show that the AC/VU decision in an individual hermaphrodite is biased by the relative birth order of the two cells, so that the first-born cell is more likely to become the VU.

Here, we suggest a possible explanation for the origin of modularity and network motifs in biology. We use standard evolutionary algorithms to evolve networks. A key feature in this study is evolution under an environment (evolutionary goal) that changes in a modular fashion. That is, we repeatedly switch between several goals, each made of a different combination of subgoals. We find that such "modularly varying goals" lead to the spontaneous evolution of modular network structure and network motifs. The resulting networks rapidly evolve to satisfy each of the different goals. Such switching between related goals may represent biological evolution in a changing environment that requires different combinations of a set of basic biological functions. The present study may shed light on the evolutionary forces that promote structural simplicity in biological networks and offers ways to improve the evolutionary design of engineered systems.}, Keywords = {escherichia-coli; pathways; origin},   Year = {2005} }@article{Kell2004a,   Author = {Kell, D.

A new tool, BLAT, is more accurate and 500 times faster than popular existing tools for mRNA/DNA alignments and 50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences. BLAT's speed stems from an index of all nonoverlapping K-mers in the genome. This index fits inside the RAM of inexpensive computers, and need only be computed once for each genome assembly. BLAT has several major stages. It uses the index to find regions in the genome likely to be homologous to the query sequence. It performs an alignment between homologous regions. It stitches together these aligned regions (often exons) into larger alignments (typically genes). Finally, BLAT revisits small internal exons possibly missed at the first stage and adjusts large gap boundaries that have canonical splice sites where feasible.

In non-sequential multipurpose batch processes, the production routes of products may be different from one another and may be in opposite direction.

For the formulation of this problem, we represented the starting and finishing time of a task in each unit with two coordinates. One is based on products, and the other is based on operation sequences. Then, we matched the variables used in the two coordinates into one with binary variables and logical constraints.

The underlying mechanism of our system is monad transformers, a simple form of abstraction for introducing a wide range of computational behaviors, such as state, I/O, continuations, and exceptions. Our work is significant in the following respects. First, we have succeeded in designing a fully modular interpreter based on monad transformers that includes features missing from Steele's (1994), Espinosa's (1993), and Wadler's (1992) earlier efforts. Second, we have found new ways to lift monad operations through monad transformers, in particular difficult cases not achieved in Moggi's (1990) original work.

In this paper we summarise the structure of CellML, its current applications (including biological pathway and electrophysiological models), and its future development-in particular, the development of toolsets and the integration of ontologies.

This simulation approach starts from a description of monomeric proteins and specifications for binding, unbinding and other reactions. This manageable specification is reasonably intuitive for biologists. Rather than requiring the inclusion of all possible complexes and reactions from the outset, our approach incorporates new complexes and reactions only when needed as the simulation proceeds. As a result, the simulation generates much smaller reaction networks, which can be exported to other simulators for further analysis.

Reconstruction of developmental GRNs requires unique computational tools that support the above representational requirements. In addition, we argue that DNA-centered network modeling, separate descriptions of network organization and network behavior, and support for network documentation and annotation are essential requirements for computational modeling of developmental GRNs.

It has recently been used in molecular biology, but so far the resulting networks have only been analysed statically(1-8). Here we present the dynamics of a biological network on a genomic scale, by integrating transcriptional regulatory information(9-11) and gene-expression data(12-16) for multiple conditions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We develop an approach for the statistical analysis of network dynamics, called SANDY, combining well-known global topological measures, local motifs and newly derived statistics. We uncover large changes in underlying network architecture that are unexpected given current viewpoints and random simulations. In response to diverse stimuli, transcription factors alter their interactions to varying degrees, thereby rewiring the network. A few transcription factors serve as permanent hubs, but most act transiently only during certain conditions. By studying sub-network structures, we show that environmental responses facilitate fast signal propagation (for example, with short regulatory cascades), whereas the cell cycle and sporulation direct temporal progression through multiple stages (for example, with highly inter-connected transcription factors). Indeed, to drive the latter processes forward, phase-specific transcription factors interregulate serially, and ubiquitously active transcription factors layer above them in a two-tiered hierarchy. We anticipate that many of the concepts presented here-particularly the large-scale topological changes and hub transience-will apply to other biological networks, including complex sub-systems in higher eukaryotes.}, Keywords = {saccharomyces-cerevisiae; transcription factors; gene-expression;metabolic networks; escherichia-coli; small-world; yeast; organization;program; motifs},   Year = {2004} }@article{Lustig2001,   Author = {Lustig, I.

To systematically address this problem, we consider the simultaneous optimization of resource-constrained scheduling of testing tasks in new product development and design/planning of batch manufacturing facilities. A multiperiod mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that maximizes the expected net present value of multiple projects is proposed. The model takes into account multiple tradeoffs and predicts which products should be tested, the detailed test schedules that satisfy resource constraints, design decisions for the process network, and production profiles for the different scenarios defined by the various testing outcomes.

The algorithm exploits the special structure of the problem, and computational experience shows that it provides optimal or near-optimal solutions, while being significantly faster than the full-space method.

The key features of the proposed model are the following: (a) a continuous-time representation is used, common for all units; (b) assignment constraints are expressed using binary variables that are defined only for tasks, not for units; (c) start times of tasks are eliminated, so that time-matching constraints are used only for the finish times of tasks; and (d) a new class of valid inequalities that improves the LP relaxation is added to the MILP formulation.

The approach is based on a continuous-time problem representation that takes into account the schedule in progress, the updated information on the batches still to be processed, the present plant state and the time data. To limit the changes on the current schedule, rescheduling operations involving local reordering and unit reallocation of old batches as well as the insertion of new batches are just permitted. In contrast to previous contributions, multiple rescheduling operations can be performed at the same time. The MILP problem formulation is iteratively solved until no further improvement on the current schedule is obtained.

Classical analytical approaches for the modelling of system components are compared to a geometrical approach.

(4) We introduce a fault tolerant control scheme for hybrid systems comprising two stages: First, we present an approach for fault detection and state estimation of Mixed Logic Dynamical systems. It casts the fault detection problem as an estimation problem. Second, we introduce strategies for the controller reconfiguration, to be used in case of faults. The algorithms are illustrated both with simulations and experiments.

In a letter dated 5June 1963 (see below), I wrote to Max [Perutz] and explained my views to him.The great diffculty about these fields [development and the nervous system]is that the nature of the problem has not yet been clearly defined, and hencethe right experimental approach is not known.

It seems to me that, bothin development and in the nervous system, one of the serious problems is ourinability to define unitary steps of any given process. ...

This is because we recognize that automata(either discrete or hybrid, terms defined subsequently in this paper), based onthe formulation of these unitary steps, can elegantly model practically all biologicalcontrol mechanisms, allow us to reason about such mechanisms in a modallogic systems with modes constructed over a next-time operator and can becomethe foundational framework for the emerging field of systems biology. In this paper,we will also see how these models can lead to more rigorous algorithmicanalysis of large amounts of biological data, produced as (numerical) traces ofin vivo, in vitro and in silico experimentscurrently a central activity for manybiologists and biochemists. Since modeling biological systems requires a carefulconsideration of both qualitative and quantitative aspects, our automata-basedtools can effectively assist the working biologists to make predictions, generatefalsifiable hypotheses and design well-focused experimentsactivities in whichthe time dimension cannot be left out of consideration.Thus, ultimately, the aim of our work is to elucidate the role played byautomata in modeling biological systems and to investigate the potential of suchtools when combined with more classical approaches used in the past to devisemodels and experiments in biology. Our discussion here is based primarily on ourexperience with a novel system that we introduced recently (called, XS-systems)and used it to implement algorithms and software tools (Simpathica). Theseconceptual tools have been integrated with prototype implementations, and arecurrently undergoing many interesting and growing sets of enhancements andoptimizationsdevelopments that can only be hinted at in this paper.Both the theoretical as well the practical aspects of our approach have focusedour attention on the very notion of automata and directed our researchevolvingnaturallytowards the study and use of hybrid automata: a family of toolsoriginally created to capture both continuous and discrete behavior in a uniqueformalism and with combined computational techniques.}, Year = {2003} }@article{Mitra1994,   Author = {Mitra, G. and Lucas, C. and Moody, S. and Hadjiconstantinou, E.},   Title = {Tools for reformulating logical forms into zero-one mixed integer programs},   Journal = {European Journal of Operational Research},   Volume = {72},   Number = {2},   Pages = {262--276},   Abstract = {A systematic procedure for transforming a set of logical statements or logical conditions imposed on a model into an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation or a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation is presented.

However, a large fraction of these newly discovered genes do not have a functional assignment. Fortunately, a variety of novel high-throughput genome-wide functional screening technologies provide important clues that shed light on gene function. The integration of heterogeneous data to predict protein function has been shown to improve the accuracy of automated gene annotation systems. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a probabilistic approach for protein function prediction that integrates protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, gene expression data, protein motif information, mutant phenotype data, and protein localization data. First, functional linkage graphs are constructed from PPI data and gene expression data, in which an edge between nodes (proteins) represents evidence for functional similarity. The assumption here is that graph neighbors are more likely to share protein function, compared to proteins that are not neighbors. The functional linkage graph model is then used in concert with protein domain, mutant phenotype and protein localization data to produce a functional prediction. Our method is applied to the functional prediction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes, using Gene Ontology (GO) terms as the basis of our annotation. In a cross validation study we show that the integrated model increases recall by 18%, compared to using PPI data alone at the 50% precision. We also show that the integrated predictor is significantly better than each individual predictor. However, the observed improvement vs. PPI depends on both the new source of data and the functional category to be predicted. Surprisingly, in some contexts integration hurts overall prediction accuracy. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive assignment of putative GO terms to 463 proteins that currently have no assigned function.}, Year = {2007} }@book{Nemhauser1999,   Author = {Nemhauser, George L. and Wolsey, Laurence A.},   Title = {Integer and combinatorial optimization},   Publisher = {Wiley},   Address = {New York},   Series = {Wiley-Interscience series in discrete mathematics and optimization}, Keywords = {Integer programming.Combinatorial optimization.},   Year = {1999} }@inproceedings{Nesnas2003,   Author = {Nesnas, Issa A.

Lateral inhibitory lin-12-mediated signaling among two bipotential cells causes one to adopt the ventral uterine precursor (VU) cell fate while the other becomes the AC. The AC then induces formation of vulval tissue. We find that the AC also induces a particular ventral uterine intermediate precursor fate (pi) by a mechanism that is genetically and temporally distinct from vulval induction. This process requires lin-12, but unlike previously described lin-12-mediated decisions, signaling is unidirectional, is between dissimilar cells and does not involve lateral inhibition. The pi fates are necessary for egg laying and appear to produce a distinct specialized cell type.

In the event detection phase, the entire integration step is searched for the state event by solving the interpolation polynomials for the discontinuity functions generated by the BDF method. An efficient hierarchical polynomial root finding procedure based upon interval arithmetic guarantees detection of the state event even if multiple state condition transitions exist in an integration step, in which case many existing algorithms may fail. As a second phase of the algorithm, a consistent event location calculation is developed that accurately locates the state event detected earlier while completely eliminating incorrect reactivation of the same state event immediately after the consistent initialization calculation that may follow.

In this framework, dynamic optimization plays an important role in order to define control strategies that, by taking into account the dynamic nature of these systems, minimize customized cost functionals subject to state and control constraints. The proposed architecture is composed of a set of hierarchical levels where a two-way information how, assuming the form of a state feedback control, is obtained through a receding horizon control scheme. The averaging effect of the receding horizon control scheme enables this deterministic approach to handle random and unexpected events at all levels of the hierarchy. At a given level, production targets to the subsystems immediately below are defined by solving appropriate optimal control problems. Efficient iterative algorithms based on optimality conditions are used to yield control strategies in the form of production rates for the various subsystems. At the lower level: this control strategy is further refined in such a way that all sequences of operations are fully specified. The minimum cost sensitivity information provided in the optimal control formulation supports a mechanism, based on the notion of a critical machine, which plays an important role in the exploitation of the available flexibility. Finally, an important point to note is that our approach is particularly suited to further integration of the production system into a larger supply chain management framework, which is well supported by recent developments in hybrid systems theory.}, Keywords = {hierarchical optimal control; manufacturing systems; receding horizon},   Year = {1997} }@article{Perkins1989,   Author = {Perkins, J.

A large scale mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model with continuous time domain representation is proposed that relies on the use of parallel time axes for units and tasks. Although in principle an LP-based branch and bound method can be used to solve the problem, there is a limitation when the instances become large. The first solution strategy that is proposed consists of the use of preordering constraints. Furthermore, a second strategy relies on a decomposition scheme for large systems which is based on the solution of an MILP model that minimizes total in process time in which assignments are determined and the subsequent solution of an LP to minimize earliness and to eliminate unnecessary setups.

The principal component of our proposed FTCS is a compensation strategy (supervisory system) which uses the information provided by the FDI to appropriately modify the controller as well as the model used in FDI. This allows online application of the FTCS without causing significant degradation in the closed-loop performance due to the occurrences of biases in sensors and actuators or due to changes in unmeasured disturbance variables and due to moderate change in process parameters. Through stochastic simulation studies of a continuous stirred tank reactor process, we demonstrate that our proposed FTCS leads to significant improvement in the closed-loop performance in comparison to a conventional control scheme, especially as the fault magnitude increases. The proposed compensation scheme also allows identification of multiple faults that occur sequentially in time and is also found to be robust with respect to moderate plant-model mismatch.}, Keywords = {performance assessment; design},   Year = {2002} }@article{Priami2001,   Author = {Priami, C. and Regev, A. and Shapiro, E. and Silverman, W.},   Title = {Application of a stochastic name-passing calculus to representation and simulation of molecular processes},   Journal = {Information Processing Letters},   Volume = {80},   Number = {1},   Pages = {25--31},   Abstract = {We describe a novel application of a stochastic name-passing calculus for the study of biomolecular systems.

They consequently end up operating in the same way as the regulated industry. The coordinated multilateral trading model lets the suppliers and consumers make a profit on their own while the Power System Operator only intervenes if the security of the power network is threatened. The PSO gives sufficient information about the status of the power network so that the brokers can arrange trades without endangering the security of the network.

There are a number of firms that maintain a middle ground, where some items are made to stock and others are made to order. This paper was motivated by a consumer product company faced with the decision about which items to make to stock and which ones to make to order, and the inventory and production policy for the make-to-stock items. The production environment is characterized by multiple items, setup times between the production of consecutive items, limited capacity, and congestion effects. In such an environment, making an item to order reduces inventory costs for that item, but might increase the lot size and inventory costs for the items made to stock. Also, lead times increase because of congestion effects, resulting in higher safety stocks for make-to-stock items and lower service levels for make-to-order items, thus leading to a complex trade-off. We develop a nonlinear, integer programming formulation of the problem. We present an efficient heuristic to solve the problem, which was motivated by key results for a special case of the problem without congestion effects that can be solved optimally. We also develop a lower bound to evaluate the performance of the heuristic. A computational study indicates that the heuristic performs well. We discuss the application of the model in a large firm and the resulting insights. We also provide insights into the impact of various problem parameters on the make-to-order versus make-to-stock decisions using a computational study. In particular, we find that the average number of setups of an item selected for make-to-stock production is always less than half the average number of setups of the item if it were to be made to order. Also, factors other than an item's demand, such as its setup time, processing time, and unit holding cost, impact the make-to-order versus make-to-stock decision.}, Keywords = {inventory/production; approximations/heuristics; multi-item; stochasticbatch production systeminventory; item},   Year = {2002} }@article{Ramadge1989,   Author = {Ramadge, P.

The resulting parallel execution preserves the semantics of the original serial program. We have implemented Jade as an extension to C, and Jade implementations exist for shared-memory multiprocessors, homogeneous message-passing machines, and heterogeneous networks of workstations. Tn this article we discuss the design goals and decisions that determined the final form of Jade and present an overview of the Jade implementation. We also present our experience using Jade to implement several complete scientific and engineering applications. We use this experience to evaluate how the different Jade language features were used in practice and how well Jade as a whole supports the process of developing parallel applications. We find that the basic idea of preserving the serial semantics simplifies the program development process, and that the concept of using data access specifications to guide the parallelization offers significant advantages over more traditional control-based approaches.

In this paper, we describe a Markov decision process (MDP) formulation of production scheduling which captures stochasticity in both production and demands. The solution to this MDP is a value function which can be used to generate optimal scheduling decisions online. A simple example illustrates the theoretical superiority of this approach over replanning-based methods.

At the first level (off line), a continuous-flow (fluid) approximation of the production control problem is formulated and solved as a Linear Program. At the second level (on line), simple distributed control policies are used to track the solution of the continuous-flow model of level one. A major research issue concerns the potential instability of decentralized tracking policies due to the discreteness of the decision space (caused by the sequential nature of operations and their discrete processing times). We consider a broad class of distributed tracking policies, which we call nonidling-nonexceeding (NINE) and find a sufficient condition for their stability. The results show the NINE policies potential instability for nonacylic systems due to machine starvation, which is caused by tracking delays induced by the discrete nature of operations. The sufficient stability condition takes a familiar form, namely that, the largest eigenvalue of a matrix-which captures the dynamics of tracking delays in the system-must be less than one. It ensures the contraction of tracking delays in the feedback loops of material flow in the system. When this condition is met, an upper bound on the performance of the policy is readily obtained. We further show that any nonidling dispatching policy (including ''Clear-A-Fraction'' policies investigated by Perkins and Kumar and Kumar and Seidman) can be considered as a special NINE policy, and thus the same stability and performance results apply to the class of all nonidling policies. We also investigate NINE policies with buffer priorities and show that a NINE policy with certain buffer priority ordering is always stable. Simulation experiments show that near-zero work-in-process and finished-parts' inventory can be achieved with the method even for demands that am very close to the production capacity of the system.}, Keywords = {manufacturing systems; machine states; algorithm; policies},   Year = {1994} }@article{Shimizu1973,   Author = {Shimizu, K. and Komaki, Y.},   Title = {Optimal control and schedule for multi-terminal, multi-item fluid transportation pipeline systems by integer programming},   Journal = {Transactions of the Society of Instrument and Control Engineers},   Volume = {9},   Number = {1},   Pages = {108--115},   Abstract = {Formulates optimal control and schedule strategies for multi- terminal and multi-item fluid transportation systems in which several sources (supply) and sinks (demand) are interconnected by pipelines and various kinds of oils are transported packed in a pipeline sequentially.

Although non-linear program (NLP) formulations have also been proposed, they suffer from some limitations. In this work, a new formulation of the simultaneous approach for HEN synthesis is proposed by representing the HEN superstructure as a process graph. This representation allows any HEN network to be evolved by circulating appropriate enthalpy flows around a set of independent loops of the process graph. By exploiting this feature, a robust and efficient NLP problem is formulated. Compared to MINLP formulations a significant reduction in terms of the size of the problem is achieved. The proposed formulation can handle fixed charges of exchangers and also design constraints such as restricted, required and forbidden matches, variable target temperatures etc. The robustness and efficiency of our formulation is demonstrated through several examples for different initial solutions including those obtained using Pinch Technology for both superstructures proposed in the literature.

Advances in data capture and conditioning, sophisticated analytical techniques, and high performance computing environments have provided improved support for all three functions. High-speed communications can transfer information and data almost without limits. Yet, maintaining consistency among the decisions in most process companies continues to be difficult and the lack of consistency has real economic consequences.

A recent hypothesis suggested that a distributed network of EGFR autocrine loops was capable of spatially modulating a simple single-peaked input into a more complex two-peaked signaling pattern, specifying the formation of a pair organ in Drosophila oogenesis (two respiratory appendages on the eggshell). To test this hypothesis, we have integrated genetic and biochemical information about the EGFR network into a mechanistic model of transport and signaling. The model allows us to estimate the relative spatial ranges and time scales of the relevant feedback loops, to interpret the phenotypic transitions in eggshell morphology and to predict the effects of new genetic manipulations. We have found that the proposed mechanism with a single diffusing inhibitor is sufficient to convert a single-peaked extracellular input into a two-peaked pattern of intracellular signaling. Based on extensive computational analysis, we predict that the same mechanism is capable of generating more complex patterns. At least indirectly, this can be used to account for more complex eggshell morphologies observed in related fly species.

The biological functions of miRNAs depend on their ability to silence gene expression, primarily via degradation of the target mRNA and/or translational suppression, mediated by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). First discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans (lin-4), miRNAs have now been identified in a wide array of organisms, including plants, zebrafish, Drosophila, and mammals. The expression of miRNAs in multicellular organisms exhibits spatiotemporal, and tissue- and cell-specificity, suggesting their involvement in tissue morphogenesis and cell differentiation. More than 200 miRNAs have been identified or predicted in mammalian cells. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of miRNAs in embryonic stem cell differentiation, limb development, adipogenesis, myogenesis, angiogenesis and hematopoiesis, neurogenesis, and epithelial morphogenesis. Overexpression (gain-of-function) and inactivation (loss-of-function) are currently the primary approaches to studying miRNA functions. Another family of small RNAs related to miRNAs is the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), generated by Dicer from long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), and produced from an induced transgene, a viral intruder, or a rogue genetic element. siRNAs silence genes via either mRNA degradation, using the RISC, or DNA methylation. siRNAs are actively being applied in basic, functional genetic studies, particularly in the generation of gene knockdown animals, as well as in gene knockdown studies of cultured cells. These studies have provided invaluable information on the specific function(s) of individual genes. siRNA technology also presents exciting potential as a therapeutic approach in disease prevention and treatment, as suggested by a recent study targeting apolipoprotein B (ApoB) in primates. Further elucidation of how miRNAs and other small RNAs interact with known and yet-to-be identified gene regulatory pathways in the cell should provide us with a more in-depth understanding of the mechanisms regulating cellular function and differentiation, and facilitate the application of small RNA technology in disease control and treatment.}, Keywords = {Animals*Cell DifferentiationCell LineageMammals/*embryology/growth & developmentMicroRNAs/*genetics/*physiology},   Year = {2006} }@article{Sonnichsen2005,   Author = {S\"{o}nnichsen, B. and Koski, L.B. and Walsh, A. and Marschall, P. and Neumann, B. and Brehm, M. and Alleaume, A.-M. and Artelt, J. and Bettencourt, P. and Cassin, E. and Hewitson, M. and Holz, C. and Khan, M. and Lazik, S. and Martin, C. and Nitzsche, B. and Ruer, M. and Stamford, J. and Winzi, M. and Heinkel, R. and Roder, M. and Finell, J. and H\"{a}ntsch, H. and Jones, S.J.M. and Jones, M. and Piano, F. and Gunsalus, K.C. and Oegema, K. and G\"{o}nczy, P. and Coulson, A. and Hyman, A.A. and Echeverri, C.J.},   Title = {Full-genome RNAi profiling of early embryogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans},   Journal = {Nature},   Volume = {434},   Number = {7032},   Pages = {462--469},   Abstract = {A key challenge of functional genomics today is to generate well-annotated data sets that can be interpreted across different platforms and technologies.

However, when the demand is high, it does not have enough capacity to meet the instantaneous demand and thus has to produce to stock in advance. Alternatively, a contractual agreement with a short-cycle manufacturer can be made. This option gives the right to receive additional production capacity when needed. There is a fixed cost to purchase this option for a period of time and, if the option is exercised, there is an additional per unit exercise price which corresponds to the cost of the goods produced at the short-cycle manufacturer.

This provides us with a detailed account of the cell with which we may begin to build models for simulating intracellular molecular processes to predict the dynamic behavior of living cells. Previous work in biochemical and genetic simulation has isolated well-characterized pathways for detailed analysis, but methods for building integrative models of the cell that incorporate gene regulation, metabolism and signaling have not been established. We, therefore, were motivated to develop a software environment for building such integrative models based on gene sets, and running simulations to conduct experiments in silico. Results: E-CELL, a modelling and simulation environment for biochemical and genetic processes, has been developed. The E-CELL system allows a user to define functions of proteins, protein-protein interactions, protein-DNA interactions, regulation of gene expressions and other features of cellular cell behavior by numerically integrating the differential equations described implicity in these reaction rules. The user can observe, through a computer display, dynamic changes in concentrations of proteins, protein complexes and other chemical compounds in the cell. Using this software, we constructed a model of a hypothetical cell with only 127 genes sufficient for transcription, translation, energy production and phospholipid synthesis. Most of the genes are taken from Mycoplasma genitalium, the organism having the smallest known chromosome, whose complete 580 kb genome sequence was determined at TIGR in 1995.

The logic disjunctions allow the conditional modeling of equations (e.g. if a unit is selected, apply mass/heat balances; otherwise, set the flow variables to zero). It is first shown that this framework for representing discrete optimization problems greatly simplifies the step of modeling. The outer approximation algorithm is then used as a basis to derive a new logic-based OA solution method which naturally gives rise to NLP sub-problems that avoid zero flows and a disjunctive LP master problem. The initial NLP sub-problems, that provide linearizations for all the terms in the disjunctions, are selected through a set-covering problem for which we consider both the cases of disjunctive and conjunctive normal form logic. The master problem, on the other hand, is converted to mixed-integer form using a convex-hull representation. Furthermore, based on some interesting relations of outer approximation with generalized Benders decomposition, it is also shown that it is possible to derive a logic-based method for the latter algorithm.

We present multiperiod mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) models for both the planning and scheduling levels. The planning model includes complex pricing functions resulting from deregulation, with a simplified pipeline description and determines feed and energy prices, as well as production levels, for a monthly horizon divided into 12-h time periods. Prices are fixed on the scheduling level, while a detailed pipeline model is included, to determine the on/off status and load steps of compressors on an hourly basis, in order to satisfy the actual demands as they become known while adhering to pressure constraints. In addition, we propose a solution methodology where the demand forecast is updated and the planning model is rerun every 12 h, while the scheduling model is run every hour and information is passed between the two levels to facilitate integration. We show that the planning model quickly becomes intractable and propose a heuristic solution method for this level based on Lagrangean decomposition. Results show that the proposed Lagrangean decomposition heuristic reduces the computational effort for solving the planning model by more than an order of magnitude compared to the commercial MINLP solver DICOPT++. It is also shown that for the majority of the plants, the power consumption and hydrogen production from the scheduling level agrees with the planning level. In some cases, however, the integration is hampered by the presence of nonlinearities, especially on the scheduling level, that lead to suboptimal or infeasible solutions. These nonlinearities need to be further addressed before the proposed methodology can be implemented in practice. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

This necessitates a data model that can be used to model any given problem instance in the form of a structured input language. Further, the language requires a parser that reads and interprets any input instance in order to capture the input data in memory and allow the formulation and solution of the corresponding optimization and simulation models. In the past, structured documentation languages have been designed for this purpose. However, such customized languages often lead to a strong coupling between the language definition and the parser implementation. Any redefinition or extension of the language to accommodate changes in the problem scope and/or optimization/simulation formulations would imply a customized extension of the parser, thus leading to software engineering difficulties. One solution to the above difficulties is provided by the Extensible Markup Language (XML) technology, a recent advance in software technology that enables extensibility and data abstraction and provides efficient data structuring parsers and object orientation. XML imposes the requirement of specifying data in an inherently hierarchical structure and provides generic parsers that do not require any re-design upon language extensions or redefinitions. This paper describes an XML-based language that has been developed for the R&D pipeline management problem, with the keywords, structural syntax, and data content models for representing all aspects of the problem. It also discusses the practical issue of effectively accessing data that gets stored in the document object model (DOM) upon parsing, by designing a set of problem definition classes (PDC), which organize the data stored in the generic DOM structure into an effective set of data structures that facilitate formulation generation. Efforts to integrate the language, the DOM parser, and the PDC in a discrete event simulation application for the R&D pipeline problem are also discussed.

First, we generated a two-hybrid interactome map of the Caenorhabditis elegans germline by using 600 transcripts enriched in this tissue [10]. We compared this map to a phenome map of the germline obtained by RNA interference (RNAi) [34] and to a transcriptome map obtained by clustering worm genes across 553 expression profiling experiments [11]. In this dataset, we find that essential proteins have a tendency to interact with each other, that pairs of genes encoding interacting proteins tend to exhibit similar expression profiles, and that, for similar to24% of germline interactions, both partners show overlapping embryonic lethal or high incidence of males RNAi phenotypes and similar expression profiles. We propose that these interactions are most likely to be relevant to germline biology. Similar integration of interactome, phenome, and transcriptome data should be possible for other biological processes in the nematode and for other organisms, including humans.}, Keywords = {protein-protein interactions; caenorhabditis-elegans; gene-expression;saccharomyces-cerevisiae; human genome; yeast; sequence; map; rna;identification},   Year = {2002} }@book{Wall1996,   Author = {Wall, Larry and Schwartz, Tom and Christiansen, Randal L.},   Title = {Programming Perl},   Publisher = {O'Reilly & Associates},   Address = {Sebastopol, CA},   Edition = {2nd},   Series = {A Nutshell handbook}, Keywords = {Perl (Computer program language)Programming Languages.Computadores (software)PERL.},   Year = {1996} }@inproceedings{Wan2000,   Author = {Zhanyong Wan and Hudak, P.},   Title = {Functional reactive programming from first principles},   BookTitle = {{ACM} {SIGPLAN} Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation ({PLDI'00})},   Series= {{SIGPLAN} Notices 35},   Address= {Vancouver, BC, Canada},   Volume = {5},   Pages = {242--252},   Abstract = {Functional reactive programming, or FRP, is a general framework for programming hybrid systems in a high-level, declarative manner.

In this paper we explore the formal semantics of FRP and how it relates to an implementation based on streams that represent (and therefore only approximate) continuous behaviors. We show that, in the limit as the sampling interval goes to zero, the implementation is faithful to the formal, continuous semantics, but only when certain constraints on behaviors are observed. We explore the nature of these constraints, which vary amongst the FRP primitives. Our results show both the power and limitations of this approach to language design and implementation.

Previous work on FRP has demonstrated its utility in a wide range of application domains, including animation, graphical user interfaces, and robotics. FRP has an elegant continuous-time denotational semantics. However, it guarantees no bounds on execution time or space, thus making it unsuitable for many embedded real-time applications. To alleviate this problem, we developed Real-Time FRP (RT-FRP), whose operational semantics permits us to formally guarantee bounds on both execution time and space. We present a formally verifiable compilation strategy from a new language based on RT-FRP into imperative code. The new language, called Event-Driven FRP (E-FRP), is more tuned to the paradigm of having multiple external events. While it is smaller than RT-FRP, it features a key construct that allows us to compile the language into efficient code. We have used this language and its compiler to generate code for a small robot controller that runs on a PIC16C66 micro-controller. Because the formal specification of compilation was crafted more for clarity and for technical convenience, we describe an implementation that produces more efficient code}, Keywords = {:functional languagesfunctional programmingmobile robotsprogram compilersprogramming language semanticsreal-time systemsevent-driven functional reactive programming; high-level declarative language; reactive systems; continuous-time denotational semantics; execution time; embedded real-timeapplications; Real-Time FRP; operational semantics; compilation strategy; imperative code; Event-Driven FRP; robot controller; mobile robots; microcontroller; formal specificationC6110 (Systems analysis and programming)C6140D (High level languages)C6150C (Compilers, interpreters and other processors)C7420 (Control engineering computing)C3390C (Mobile robots)C4210L (Formal languages and computational linguistics)P (Practical)T (Theoretical or Mathematical)},   Year = {2002} }@phdthesis{Wan2003,   Author = {Wan, Zhanyong},   Title = {Functional Reactive Programming for Real-Time Reactive Systems},   School = {Yale University},   Abstract = {A real-time reactive system continuously reacts to stimuli from the environment by sending out responses, where each reaction must be made within certain time bound. As computers are used more often to control all kinds of devices, such systems are gaining popularity rapidly. However, the programming tools for them lag behind.In this thesis we present RT-FRP, a language for real-time reactive systems. RT-FRP can be executed with guaranteed resource bounds, and improves on previous languages for the same domain by allowing a restricted form of recursive switching, which is a source of both expressiveness and computational cost. The balance between cost guarantee and expressiveness is achieved with a carefully designed syntax and type system.To better suit hybrid systems and event-driven systems, we have designed two variants of RT-FRP called H-FRP and E-FRP respectively. We give H-FRP a continuous-time semantics natural for modeling hybrid systems and an operational semantics suitable for a discrete implementation. We show that under certain conditions the operational semantics converges to the continuous-time semantics as the sampling interval approaches zero. We also present a provably correct compiler for E-FRP, and use E-FRP to program both real and simulated robots.}, Year = {2003} }@article{Wang1993,   Author = {Wang, B.

The structure(s) of the individual monomers must be found and the transformations to produce the packing interfaces must be described. A substantial difficulty results from ambiguities in assigning intermolecular distance measurements (from nuclear magnetic resonance, for example) to particular intermolecular interfaces in the structure. Here we present a rapid and efficient method to solve the packing and the assignment problems simultaneously given rigid monomer structures and (potentially ambiguous) intermolecular distance measurements. A promising application of this algorithm is to couple it with a monomer searching protocol such that each monomer structure consistent with intramolecular constraints can be subsequently input to the current algorithm to check whether it is consistent with (potentially ambiguous) intermolecular constraints. The algorithm AmbiPack, uses a hierarchical division of the search space and the branch-and-bound algorithm to eliminate infeasible regions of the space, Local search methods are then focused on the remaining space. The algorithm generally runs faster as more constraints are included because more regions of the search space can be eliminated. This is not the case for other methods, for which additional constraints increase the complexity of the search space. The algorithm presented is guaranteed to find all solutions to a predetermined resolution. This resolution can be chosen arbitrarily to produce outputs at various level of detail.

Furthermore, we show that positive autoregulation of lin-12 transcription in the presumptive VU is mediated by a cis-acting 5' regulatory sequence and is necessary to specify the VU fate.

Subsequently, this effect is counteracted by the expression of multiple new negative regulators of the EGFR-MAPK pathway, under direct transcriptional control of the LIN-12-mediated lateral signal.}, Keywords = {caenorhabditis-elegans; induction; notch; drosophila; receptor; protein},   Year = {2004} }@article{Yu2004,   Author = {Yu, H.

They are globally characterized by a variety of graph-theoretic statistics, such as the degree distribution, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length and diameter. Moreover, real protein networks are quite complex and can often be divided into many sub-networks through systematic selection of different nodes and edges. For instance, proteins can be sub-divided by expression level, length, amino-acid composition, solubility, secondary structure and function. A challenging research question is to compare the topologies of sub- networks, looking for global differences associated with different types of proteins. TopNet is an automated web tool designed to address this question, calculating and comparing topological characteristics for different sub-networks derived from any given protein network. It provides reasonable solutions to the calculation of network statistics for sub-networks embedded within a larger network and gives simplified views of a sub-network of interest, allowing one to navigate through it. After constructing TopNet, we applied it to the interaction networks and protein classes currently available for yeast. We were able to find a number of potential biological correlations. In particular, we found that soluble proteins had more interactions than membrane proteins. Moreover, amongst soluble proteins, those that were highly expressed, had many polar amino acids, and had many alpha helices, tended to have the most interaction partners. Interestingly, TopNet also turned up some systematic biases in the current yeast interaction network: on average, proteins with a known functional classification had many more interaction partners than those without. This phenomenon may reflect the incompleteness of the experimentally determined yeast interaction network.}, Keywords = {small-world networks; saccharomyces-cerevisiae; complex networks; yeastproteome; coiled coils; wide-web; genomes; evolution; database; internet},   Year = {2004} }@article{Yu2006,   Author = {Yu, H. and Xia, Y. and Trifonov, V. and Gerstein, M.},   Title = {Design principles of molecular networks revealed by global comparisons and composite motifs},   Journal = {Genome Biology},   Volume = {7},   Number = {7},   Pages = {R55.1--R55.11},   Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular networks are of current interest, particularly with the publication of many large-scale datasets. Previous analyses have focused on topologic structures of individual networks. RESULTS: Here, we present a global comparison of four basic molecular networks: regulatory, co-expression, interaction, and metabolic. In terms of overall topologic correlation--whether nearby proteins in one network are close in another--we find that the four are quite similar. However, focusing on the occurrence of local features, we introduce the concept of composite hubs, namely hubs shared by more than one network. We find that the three 'action' networks (metabolic, co-expression, and interaction) share the same scaffolding of hubs, whereas the regulatory network uses distinctly different regulator hubs. Finally, we examine the inter-relationship between the regulatory network and the three action networks, focusing on three composite motifs--triangles, trusses, and bridges--involving different degrees of regulation of gene pairs. Our analysis shows that interaction and co-expression networks have short-range relationships, with directly interacting and co-expressed proteins sharing regulators. However, the metabolic network contains many long-distance relationships: far-away enzymes in a pathway often have time-delayed expression relationships, which are well coordinated by bridges connecting their regulators. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate how basic molecular networks are distinct yet connected and well coordinated. Many of our conclusions can be mapped onto structured social networks, providing intuitive comparisons. In particular, the long-distance regulation in metabolic networks agrees with its counterpart in social networks (namely, assembly lines). Conversely, the segregation of regulator hubs from other hubs diverges from social intuitions (as managers often are centers of interactions).}, Year = {2006} }@inproceedings{Zefran2001,   Author = {Zefran, M. and Bullo, F. and Stein, M.},   Title = {A notion of passivity for hybrid systems},   BookTitle = {40th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control},   Address= {Orlando, FL, USA},   Volume = {1},   Pages = {768--773},   Abstract = {We propose a notion of passivity for hybrid systems. Our work is motivated by problems in haptics and teleoperation where several computer controlled mechanical systems are connected through a communication channel. To account for time delays and to better react to user actions it is desirable to design controllers that can switch between different operating modes. Each of the interacting systems can be therefore naturally modeled as a hybrid system. A traditional passivity definition requires that a storage function exists that is common to all operating modes. We show that stability of the system can be guaranteed even if different storage function is found for each of the modes, provided appropriate conditions are satisfied when the system switches}, Keywords = {:continuous time systemsdiscrete systemsfeedbackhaptic interfacesLyapunov methodsstability criteriateleroboticspassivity; hybrid systems; haptics; teleoperation; computer controlled mechanical systems; haptic interfaces; telerobotics; Lyapunov methods; stability criteria; discrete systems;continuous time systems; feedback; time delays; user actions; stability; Lyapunov functionsC1320 (Stability in control theory)C5540B (Interactive-input devices)C6180 (User interfaces)C3390T (Telerobotics)C1340D (Discrete control systems)A (Application)T (Theoretical or Mathematical)},   Year = {2001} }@article{Zentner1998,   Author = {Zentner, M.

The goal of RCSPec is to provide a compact, intuitive, and context independent means of representing the wide variety of process scheduling problems that arise in the chemical/pharmaceutical industry. In practice, RCSPec allows for rapid modification of problem features, promotes detection of ill-posed scenarios, and can serve as a vehicle for expressing standard test problems on which researchers can compare results. As an example of its application, several problems from the literature are expressed and computational results are presented for parsing and translating their descriptions to a formulation based on time discretization. RCSPec is independent of the formulation into which it is translated so that alternative formulation/solution strategies may be applied to the same problem description. Supporting additional formulations involves modifying the translation process, whereas parsing is unaffected. A library of test problems expressed in RCSPec, problem file error checking code, and information about RCSPec version updates are electronically available.

Model construction, modification and information exchange between different users is thus considerably simplified. For a given model, the program can then be used to predict all the extreme point flux distributions that optimize an objective function while satisfying balances and constraints by using a depth-first search strategy. One can also find the minimum reaction set that satisfies different conditions. Based on the identified flux distributions or linear combinations, the user can simulate the NMR and GC/MS spectra of selected signal molecules. Alternately, spectra vectorization allows for the automated optimization of labeling experiments that are intended to distinguish between different, yet plausible flux extreme point distributions. The example provided entails predicting the flux distributions associated with deleting pyruvate kinase and designing C-13 NMR experiments that can maximally discriminate between the flux distributions.
